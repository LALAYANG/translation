The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves reading a sequence of characters from standard input, and then performing some calculations based on the sequence. The code uses several Python libraries, including `datetime`, `threading`, `queue`, and `scipy`.

To translate this code to Java, we would need to replace the Python libraries with their Java equivalents. For example, we would use the `java.util.Date` class to replace the `datetime` library, and the `java.util.concurrent` package to replace the `threading` library.

Here is an example of how the code could be translated to Java:
```
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Read the input from standard input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();

        // Split the input into a list of characters
        List<Character> characters = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
            characters.add(input.charAt(i));
        }

        // Create a thread pool to perform the calculations
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);

        // Create a future to store the result of the calculations
        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
            // Perform the calculations
            int N = characters.size();
            int max_changes = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
                if (characters.get(i) != characters.get(i + 1)) {
                    max_changes++;
                }
            }
            int variable_6_47 = 1;
            int cur_happy = N - max_changes - variable_6_47;
            int ans = cur_happy + 2 * max_changes;
            return ans;
        });

        // Wait for the calculations to complete
        try {
            int result = future.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            System.out.println(result);
        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException | TimeoutException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses the `java.util.concurrent` package to create a thread pool and submit a task to the pool. The task performs the calculations and returns the result. The main thread then waits for the task to complete and prints the result.

Note that this code is just an example, and may not be the most efficient or effective way to solve the problem. The specific implementation will depend on the requirements of the problem and the constraints of the system.
