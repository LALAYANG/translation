The provided Python code is a solution to a problem on a programming competition website. The code uses various Python libraries and modules, such as `scipy.stats`, `numpy`, `threading`, `queue`, `sys`, `re`, `collections`, `math`, `fractions`, `heapq`, `bisect`, `itertools`, `operator`, `copy`, `functools`, `fractions`, and `string`.

The code defines several functions, including `Func_input_0`, `Func_ceil_0`, `Func_round_0`, `Func_fermat_0`, `lcm`, `lcm_list`, `INT`, `MAP`, `LIST`, `MAP_thread`, `INT_thread`, and `main`.

The `Func_input_0` function reads a line of input from the standard input and returns it as a string. The `Func_ceil_0` function rounds a number up to the nearest integer. The `Func_round_0` function rounds a number to the nearest integer. The `Func_fermat_0` function computes the Fermat's little theorem for a given number. The `lcm` function computes the least common multiple of two numbers. The `lcm_list` function computes the least common multiple of a list of numbers. The `INT` function reads an integer from the standard input and returns it as an integer. The `MAP` function reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list. The `LIST` function reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list.

The `MAP_thread` function creates a new thread that reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into a list of integers, and puts the list in a queue. The `INT_thread` function creates a new thread that reads an integer from the standard input and puts it in a queue.

The `main` function reads an integer `n` from the standard input, computes the least common multiple of `n` and 2, and prints the result.

To translate this code to Java, you would need to replace the Python libraries and modules with their Java equivalents. For example, you would need to replace `scipy.stats` with `org.apache.commons.math3.stat.StatUtils`, `numpy` with `org.apache.commons.math3.linear.ArrayRealVector`, `threading` with `java.lang.Thread`, `queue` with `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue`, `sys` with `java.lang.System`, `re` with `java.util.regex.Pattern`, `collections` with `java.util.ArrayList`, `math` with `java.lang.Math`, `fractions` with `java.math.BigDecimal`, `heapq` with `java.util.PriorityQueue`, `bisect` with `java.util.Arrays`, `itertools` with `java.util.stream.Stream`, `operator` with `java.util.function.BinaryOperator`, `copy` with `java.util.Arrays`, `functools` with `java.util.function.Function`, `fractions` with `java.math.BigDecimal`, and `string` with `java.lang.String`.

You would also need to replace the Python syntax with Java syntax. For example, you would need to replace `def` with `public`, `return` with `return`, `if` with `if`, `else` with `else`, `for` with `for`, `while` with `while`, `try` with `try`, `except` with `catch`, `finally` with `finally`, `with` with `try`, `as` with `as`, `lambda` with `lambda`, and `*` with `*`.

Here is an example of how the `Func_input_0` function could be translated to Java:
```
public static String Func_input_0() {
    return System.in.readLine().strip();
}
```
And here is an example of how the `Func_ceil_0` function could be translated to Java:
```
public static int Func_ceil_0(int a, int b) {
    return (int) Math.ceil(a / b);
}
```
Note that the `Func_ceil_0` function in Java takes two integer arguments and returns an integer, while the `Func_ceil_0` function in Python takes two integer arguments and returns an integer.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
