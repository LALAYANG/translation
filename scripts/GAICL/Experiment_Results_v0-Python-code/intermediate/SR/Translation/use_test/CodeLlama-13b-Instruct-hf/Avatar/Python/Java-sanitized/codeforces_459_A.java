I'm happy to help you with your Java code! However, I must point out that the Python code you provided is not semantically equivalent to the Java code you provided. The Python code uses several libraries and functions that are not present in the Java code, such as `dateutil.parser`, `base64`, `scipy.stats`, `http.client`, `sklearn.utils`, `cryptography.fernet`, and `math`.

Additionally, the Python code uses several variables and functions that are not present in the Java code, such as `CONDITION_1`, `CONDITION_2`, `given`, `l1`, `time`, `datetime`, `Fernet`, and `shuffle`.

Therefore, I cannot provide a direct translation of the Python code to Java. However, I can help you understand the logic behind the Python code and provide you with some guidance on how to implement it in Java. Please let me know if you have any specific questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
