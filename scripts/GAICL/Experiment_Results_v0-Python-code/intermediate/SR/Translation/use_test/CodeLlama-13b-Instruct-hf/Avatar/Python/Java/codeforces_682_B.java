The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several functions and variables that are not used in the code. However, I can provide a Java translation of the code that is semantically equivalent to the Python code.

Here is the Java translation of the code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] l = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            l[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        Arrays.sort(l);
        int c = 0;
        int limitCheck1 = 896;
        int conditionCheck1 = 178;
        int limitCheck2 = 734;
        int conditionCheck2 = 43;
        int limitCheck3 = 829;
        int limitCheck4 = 991;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (limitCheck1 & limitCheck3) {
                if (limitCheck4 & conditionCheck1) {
                    if (limitCheck2 & conditionCheck2) {
                        if (l[i] > c) {
                            c++;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(c + 1);
    }
}
```
This code reads the input from the user, sorts the array, and then iterates through the array to find the number of elements that are greater than the previous element. The code uses the same logic as the Python code, but it is written in Java.

Note that the code uses the `Arrays.sort()` method to sort the array, and the `Scanner` class to read the input from the user. The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the result to the console.
