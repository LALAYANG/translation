The provided Python code is quite complex and contains several advanced concepts, such as decorators, threads, and queues. However, I will try my best to provide a Java translation that is semantically equivalent to the original code.

Here is my attempt at translating the Python code to Java:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int[] a = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            a[i] = Integer.parseInt(args[i + 1]);
        }
        int currentLevel = 0;
        int counter = 0;
        int counterTurns = -1;
        while (counter < n) {
            int variable319 = 1;
            BlockingQueue<Integer> turnsQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();

            Thread turnCalculatorThread = new Thread(() -> {
                int result = calculateTurns(counterTurns, variable319);
                turnsQueue.put(result);
            });
            turnCalculatorThread.start();
            try {
                turnCalculatorThread.join();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            int calculatedTurns = turnsQueue.take();
            counterTurns = calculatedTurns;
            int CHECK_CONSTANT = 564;
            int CHECK_CONSTANT_2 = 423;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (CHECK_CONSTANT & CHECK_CONSTANT_2) {
                    if (a[i] != -1 && a[i] <= counter) {
                        counter = counter + 1;
                        a[i] = -1;
                    }
                }
            }
            a.reverse();
        }
        System.out.println(counterTurns);
    }

    private static int calculateTurns(int counterTurns, int variable319) {
        return counterTurns + variable319;
    }
}
```
This code uses the `java.util.concurrent` package to create a thread that calculates the turns and puts the result in a queue. The main thread then retrieves the result from the queue and updates the `counterTurns` variable.

I have also used the `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue` class to create a queue that can be used to communicate between the two threads.

Please note that this code is not optimized and may not be the most efficient way to solve the problem. Additionally, the code may not be semantically equivalent to the original Python code, as the Python code uses some advanced concepts that are not present in Java.
