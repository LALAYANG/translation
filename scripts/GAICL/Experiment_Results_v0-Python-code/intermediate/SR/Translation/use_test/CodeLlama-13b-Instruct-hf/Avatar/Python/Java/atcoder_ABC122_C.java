The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves finding the number of occurrences of a specific pattern in a given string. The code first takes in two inputs: the length of the string and the number of queries. It then takes in the string and the queries, which are represented as pairs of integers (l, r) that represent the starting and ending indices of the pattern to be searched for.

The code then defines a function called `count` that takes in two arguments: `total` and `i`. The function returns the value of `total + 1` if the substring of the string `s` starting at index `i - 1` and ending at index `i + 1` is equal to the pattern 'AC', and returns `total` otherwise. The function is then used to create a list called `cumsum` that contains the cumulative sum of the values returned by the `count` function for each index in the string.

The code then defines a function called `solver` that takes in three arguments: `LoopIndexOut`, `stop`, and `step`. The function first checks if `step` is equal to 0 or if `step` is greater than 0 and `LoopIndexOut` is greater than or equal to `stop`, or if `step` is less than 0 and `LoopIndexOut` is less than or equal to `stop`. If any of these conditions are met, the function returns. Otherwise, the function calculates the t-test statistic for the given data using the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module.

The function then iterates over the queries and prints the difference between the cumulative sum of the values returned by the `count` function for the ending index of the query and the cumulative sum of the values returned by the `count` function for the starting index of the query.

The code then calls the `solver` function with the arguments `0`, `limit // divisor`, and `1`. The `limit` variable is set to 370, and the `divisor` variable is set to 369.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int q = scanner.nextInt();
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        List<List<Integer>> queries = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
            List<Integer> query = new ArrayList<>();
            query.add(scanner.nextInt());
            query.add(scanner.nextInt());
            queries.add(query);
        }

        int[] cumsum = new int[n];
        cumsum[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            cumsum[i] = cumsum[i - 1] + (s.substring(i - 1, i + 1).equals("AC") ? 1 : 0);
        }

        int limit = 370;
        int divisor = 369;

        for (int i = 0; i < limit / divisor; i++) {
            for (List<Integer> query : queries) {
                int l = query.get(0);
                int r = query.get(1);
                System.out.println(cumsum[r - 1] - cumsum[l - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read in the input from the user, and the `List` and `ArrayList` classes to store the queries and the cumulative sum of the values returned by the `count` function. The `String` class is used to represent the input string, and the `substring` method is used to extract the substring of the string that corresponds to the pattern 'AC'. The `equals` method is used to compare the substring to the pattern 'AC', and the `?:` operator is used to return the value of `total + 1` if the substring is equal to the pattern, and `total` otherwise.

The code then calculates the cumulative sum of the values returned by the `count` function for each index in the string, and stores the result in an array called `cumsum`.

The code then defines a loop that iterates over the queries and prints the difference between the cumulative sum of the values returned by the `count` function for the ending index of the query and the cumulative sum of the values returned by the `count` function for the starting index of the query. The loop is executed `limit / divisor` times, where `limit` is set to 370 and `divisor` is set to 369.

Note that the code assumes that the input string is a sequence of characters, and that the pattern 'AC' is a sequence of two characters. If the input string is a sequence of integers, or if the pattern 'AC' is a sequence of integers, the code will need to be modified accordingly.
