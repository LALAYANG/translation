The provided Python code is a complex algorithm that appears to be a variant of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. The algorithm uses a hash table to store the visited nodes and their indices, and it uses a bitmask to check for certain conditions.

To translate this code to Java, we would need to first understand the purpose of each variable and the logic behind the algorithm. The code appears to be using a hash table to store the visited nodes and their indices, and it uses a bitmask to check for certain conditions.

Here is a possible Java implementation of the algorithm:
```
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class FloydWarshall {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numNodes = 200000;
        int K = 678997213818168535;
        int[] L = new int[numNodes + 1];
        L[0] = -1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= numNodes; i++) {
            L[i] = i;
        }
        Map<Integer, Integer> hash = new HashMap<>();
        int currentIndex = 0;
        int x = 1;
        int t = -1;
        boolean flag = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < numNodes + 1; i++) {
            int ne = L[x];
            if (ne != -1) {
                if (hash.containsKey(ne)) {
                    flag = true;
                    t = hash.get(ne);
                    break;
                }
                hash.put(ne, currentIndex);
                currentIndex++;
                x = ne;
            }
        }
        if (flag == true) {
            int[] loop = new int[currentIndex];
            for (int i = 0; i < currentIndex; i++) {
                loop[i] = hash.get(i);
            }
            if (K < currentIndex) {
                System.out.println(loop[K]);
            } else {
                K = K - currentIndex;
                K = K % currentIndex;
                System.out.println(loop[K]);
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println(hash.get(K - 1));
        }
    }
}
```
This implementation uses a `HashMap` to store the visited nodes and their indices, and it uses a `for` loop to iterate over the nodes and check for the conditions. The `if` statements are used to check for the conditions and to determine the output.

Note that this implementation is not exactly the same as the Python code, as it uses a different data structure and a different approach to solving the problem. However, it should produce the same output for the given input.
