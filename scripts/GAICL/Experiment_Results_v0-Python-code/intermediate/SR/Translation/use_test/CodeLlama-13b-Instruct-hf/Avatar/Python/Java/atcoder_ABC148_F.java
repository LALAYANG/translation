The provided Python code is a solution to a problem on a programming contest. It is not a complete program, but rather a set of functions and variables that can be used to solve the problem.

The code defines several functions, including `inp()`, `inpl()`, `inpl_thread()`, `build_graph_edges()`, `ta_dfs()`, `ao_dfs()`, and `main()`. The `inp()` function reads a line from standard input and returns an integer. The `inpl()` function reads a line from standard input and returns a list of integers. The `inpl_thread()` function creates a new thread that reads a line from standard input and puts the result in a queue. The `build_graph_edges()` function builds a graph from a list of edges. The `ta_dfs()` function performs a depth-first search on the graph starting from a given node. The `ao_dfs()` function performs a depth-first search on the graph starting from a given node. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program and calls the other functions to solve the problem.

The code also defines several variables, including `n`, `ta`, `ao`, `g`, `ta_dist`, `ao_dist`, `res`, and `INF`. The `n` variable is the number of nodes in the graph. The `ta` variable is the index of the starting node for the depth-first search. The `ao` variable is the index of the starting node for the depth-first search. The `g` variable is a list of lists representing the graph. The `ta_dist` variable is a list of distances from the starting node to each node in the graph. The `ao_dist` variable is a list of distances from the starting node to each node in the graph. The `res` variable is the maximum distance from the starting node to any node in the graph. The `INF` variable is a large number used as an upper bound for the distances.

The code is written in Python and uses several libraries, including `numpy`, `threading`, `queue`, `collections`, `heapq`, `sys`, `bisect`, `math`, `itertools`, `pprint`, and `fractions`.

To translate this code to Java, you would need to rewrite the code in Java syntax, using Java libraries and data structures instead of Python libraries and data structures. You would also need to modify the code to use Java's concurrency features, such as threads and locks, to perform the depth-first search in parallel.

Here is an example of how the code could be translated to Java:
```
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int ta = scanner.nextInt();
        int ao = scanner.nextInt();
        List<List<Integer>> g = new ArrayList<>(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            g.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        int[] ta_dist = new int[n];
        int[] ao_dist = new int[n];
        int res = 0;
        int INF = 1000000000;

        // Build the graph
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int a = scanner.nextInt();
            int b = scanner.nextInt();
            g.get(a - 1).add(b - 1);
            g.get(b - 1).add(a - 1);
        }

        // Perform the depth-first search
        Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
        Thread taThread = new Thread(() -> {
            ta_dfs(ta, lock);
        });
        Thread aoThread = new Thread(() -> {
            ao_dfs(ao, lock);
        });
        taThread.start();
        aoThread.start();
        try {
            taThread.join();
            aoThread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Calculate the maximum distance
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (ta_dist[i] > ao_dist[i]) {
                continue;
            }
            res = Math.max(res, ao_dist[i]);
        }

        System.out.println(res - 1);
    }

    private static void ta_dfs(int node, Lock lock) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            for (int v : g.get(node)) {
                if (ta_dist[v] != null) {
                    continue;
                }
                ta_dist[v] = ta_dist[node] + 1;
                ta_dfs(v, lock);
            }
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    private static void ao_dfs(int node, Lock lock) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            for (int v : g.get(node)) {
                if (ao_dist[v] != null) {
                    continue;
                }
                ao_dist[v] = ao_dist[node] + 1;
                ao_dfs(v, lock);
            }
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses Java's concurrency features, such as threads and locks, to perform the depth-first search in parallel. It also uses Java's `ArrayList` and `List` classes to represent the graph and the distances.

Note that this is just one possible way to translate the code to Java, and there may be other ways to do it. Additionally, this code is not optimized for performance, and it may not be the most efficient way to solve the problem.
