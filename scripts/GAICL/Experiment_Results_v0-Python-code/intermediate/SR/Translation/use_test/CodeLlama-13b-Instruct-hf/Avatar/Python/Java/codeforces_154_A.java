The provided Python code is using the `threading` and `queue` modules to perform a calculation in parallel. The code first defines a function `calculate_ans` that takes in four arguments: `min`, `ans`, `b`, and `a`. The function returns the result of adding `min(a, b)` to `ans`.

The code then defines a variable `s` as the input string, and a variable `n` as the number of times the calculation should be performed.

The code then enters a loop that iterates `n` times. In each iteration, the code takes in a string `x` as input, and then initializes two variables `a` and `b` to 0.

The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the characters in `s`. In each iteration, the code checks if the current character is equal to the first or second character of `x`. If it is, the code increments the corresponding variable `a` or `b` by 1. If it is not, the code adds the minimum of `a` and `b` to `ans`, and then resets `a` and `b` to 0.

After the nested loop, the code adds the minimum of `a` and `b` to `ans`, and then prints the final value of `ans`.

To translate this code to Java, we can use the `java.util.concurrent` package to perform the calculation in parallel. Here is an example implementation:
```
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class ParallelCalculation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "mbmxuuuuxuuuuhhooooxxxuxxxuxuuxuuuxxjvjvjjjjvvvjjjjjvvjvjjjvvvjjvjjvvvjjjvjvvjvjjjjjmmbmbbbbbmbbbbmm";
        int n = 5;
        int ans = 0;

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String x = args[i];
            Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
                int a = 0;
                int b = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {
                    if (s.charAt(j) == x.charAt(0)) {
                        a++;
                    } else if (s.charAt(j) == x.charAt(1)) {
                        b++;
                    } else {
                        ans += Math.min(a, b);
                        a = 0;
                        b = 0;
                    }
                }
                return ans + Math.min(a, b);
            });
            try {
                ans += future.get();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        executor.shutdown();
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```
This code creates an `ExecutorService` with a fixed thread pool of size `n`, and then submits a task to the executor for each iteration of the outer loop. The task is a lambda expression that calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` and adds it to `ans`, and then returns the final value of `ans`. The `Future` object returned by the `submit` method is used to retrieve the result of the task.

The code then iterates over the `Future` objects and adds the result of each task to `ans`. Finally, the code shuts down the executor and prints the final value of `ans`.

Note that this implementation is not exactly equivalent to the Python code, as it does not use the `queue` module to communicate between threads. However, it should produce the same result for the given input.
