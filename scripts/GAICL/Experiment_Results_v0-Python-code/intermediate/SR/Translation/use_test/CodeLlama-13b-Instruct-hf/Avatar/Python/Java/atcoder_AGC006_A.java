The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several libraries and functions that are not commonly used in Java. However, I can provide a Java implementation of the main logic of the program.

Here is a possible implementation of the program in Java:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        String targetString = scanner.nextLine();

        if (s.equals(targetString)) {
            System.out.println(n);
        } else {
            int cnt = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n - i; j++) {
                    if (s.charAt(i + j) != targetString.charAt(j)) {
                        break;
                    }
                    if (j == n - i - 1) {
                        cnt = n - i;
                    }
                }
            }
            System.out.println(2 * n - cnt);
        }
    }
}
```
This implementation uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `String` class to manipulate strings. The main logic of the program is similar to the Python code, with the exception that Java does not have a built-in `ttest_ind` function, so we need to implement it ourselves.

The `ttest_ind` function in the Python code is used to calculate the p-value of a two-sample t-test. In Java, we can use the `TTest` class from the Apache Commons Math library to perform the same calculation.

Here is an example of how to use the `TTest` class to perform a two-sample t-test in Java:
```java
import org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference.TTest;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double[] sample1 = {54, 70, 29};
        double[] sample2 = {3, 84, 21};
        TTest ttest = new TTest();
        double pValue = ttest.tTest(sample1, sample2);
        System.out.println(pValue);
    }
}
```
This code will print the p-value of the two-sample t-test, which is a measure of the probability that the difference between the two samples is due to chance.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
