This is a Python program that solves a problem using a specific algorithm. The program is written in a way that is difficult to understand for a Java programmer, as it uses many Python-specific features and libraries, such as the `scipy.stats` library for statistical calculations, the `threading` library for parallel processing, and the `queue` library for inter-thread communication.

To translate this program to Java, you would need to rewrite it using Java-specific libraries and features, such as the `java.util.concurrent` library for parallel processing and the `java.util.Queue` class for inter-thread communication. You would also need to rewrite the program's algorithm and data structures to be more Java-like, as Python and Java have different syntax and semantics.

Here is an example of how the program could be translated to Java:
```
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Read input from stdin
        int N = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int M = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);

        // Create a queue to store the balls
        LinkedBlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();

        // Create a thread pool to process the balls
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(N);

        // Create a future to store the result
        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
            // Process the balls
            int ans = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                int x = queue.take();
                int y = queue.take();
                if (x == y) {
                    ans++;
                }
            }
            return ans;
        });

        // Add the balls to the queue
        IntStream.range(0, N).forEach(i -> queue.add(i));

        // Shut down the thread pool
        executor.shutdown();

        // Wait for the future to complete
        int result = future.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        // Print the result
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```
This is just one possible way to translate the program to Java, and there are many other ways to do it. The key is to understand the program's algorithm and data structures, and to rewrite them in a way that is more Java-like.
