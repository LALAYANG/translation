The given Python code is a solution to a problem on a programming contest. It uses a decorator to wrap a function and add some additional functionality to it. The decorator is called `my_decorator` and it takes a function as an argument. The decorator function returns a new function that calls the original function and then performs some additional operations.

The original function is called `Func_dist_0` and it takes two arguments `x` and `y`. The function calculates the Euclidean distance between the two points represented by `x` and `y`.

The decorator function `my_decorator` calls the original function `Func_dist_0` and then performs some additional operations. It first calls the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module to calculate the t-test statistic for two sets of data. It then calculates the Euclidean distance between the two points represented by `x` and `y` and returns the result.

The Python code also uses a nested loop to iterate over the points in the `points` list and calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of points. It then checks if the distance is an integer and increments the `count` variable if it is. Finally, it prints the value of `count`.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        List<List<Integer>> points = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            List<Integer> point = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int j = 0; j < d; j++) {
                point.add(scanner.nextInt());
            }
            points.add(point);
        }
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (Func_dist_0(points.get(i), points.get(j)).isInteger()) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }

    public static double Func_dist_0(List<Integer> x, List<Integer> y) {
        double tmp = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < d; i++) {
            tmp += (x.get(i) - y.get(i)) * (x.get(i) - y.get(i));
        }
        return Math.sqrt(tmp);
    }
}
```
In this Java code, we first read the input from the user and store it in a list of lists called `points`. We then iterate over the points in the `points` list and calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of points using the `Func_dist_0` function. We then check if the distance is an integer and increment the `count` variable if it is. Finally, we print the value of `count`.

The `Func_dist_0` function takes two lists of integers as arguments and calculates the Euclidean distance between the two points represented by the lists. It first calculates the square of the difference between the corresponding elements of the two lists and then returns the square root of the sum of these squares.

Note that the Java code uses the `Math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of a number, and the `Math.isInteger` function to check if a number is an integer.
