The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several libraries and functions that are not commonly used in Java. However, I can provide a high-level overview of the code and explain how it works.

The code first defines a decorator function called `my_decorator` that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that performs some additional computations before calling the original function. The decorator function is then used to decorate the `recursive_array_update` function, which is a recursive function that updates an array based on the input string.

The `initial_computation` function is then called to compute the initial value of the array, and the `recursive_array_update` function is called to update the array. The `query_count` variable is then used to read input from the user and update the array accordingly.

The code then defines a new function called `input_and_append` that takes an input string and appends the result of the `recursive_array_update` function to an array. This function is then called to read input from the user and append the result to the array.

Finally, the code prints the contents of the array to the console.

As for the Java code, it would be similar to the Python code, but with some differences in syntax and structure. Here is an example of how the code might be written in Java:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String soz = scanner.nextLine();
        int factor = 1;
        int variable_7_8 = 1;
        int[] newa_1 = new int[soz.length() + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= soz.length(); i++) {
            newa_1[i] = newa_1[i - 1];
            if (soz.charAt(i - 1) == soz.charAt(i)) {
                newa_1[i] += 1;
            }
        }

        int newn_1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[newn_1];

        for (int i = 0; i < newn_1; i++) {
            String[] input = scanner.nextLine().split(" ");
            int newm_1 = Integer.parseInt(input[0]);
            int l = Integer.parseInt(input[1]);
            arr[i] = newa_1[l - 1] - newa_1[newm_1 - 1];
        }

        for (int i : arr) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `String` and `Integer` classes to parse the input and perform calculations. The `for` loops are used to iterate over the input string and update the array accordingly. Finally, the `System.out.println` method is used to print the contents of the array to the console.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
