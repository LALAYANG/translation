The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves finding the number of ways to color a graph with `N` nodes and `K` colors, such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. The code uses a recursive approach to solve the problem, and it is written in a way that is difficult to understand for a Java programmer.

To translate the code to Java, we would need to rewrite it in a way that is more Java-like. Here is one possible way to do this:
```
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class GraphColoring {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int K = scanner.nextInt();
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
            int a = scanner.nextInt();
            int b = scanner.nextInt();
            graph.get(a - 1).add(b - 1);
            graph.get(b - 1).add(a - 1);
        }
        int mod = 1000000007;
        int ans = dfs(0, -1, K, graph, mod);
        System.out.println(ans);
    }

    private static int dfs(int fro, int to, int f, List<List<Integer>> graph, int mod) {
        int caseNum = f;
        int colorNum = K - 1;
        if (f == K) {
            colorNum = K - 2;
        }
        for (int u : graph.get(fro)) {
            if (u == to) {
                continue;
            }
            int pat = dfs(u, fro, colorNum, graph, mod);
            if (pat == 0) {
                caseNum = 0;
                break;
            }
            caseNum = (caseNum * pat) % mod;
            colorNum--;
        }
        return caseNum;
    }
}
```
This code uses a similar approach to the original Python code, but it is written in a more Java-like style. It uses a `List` to represent the graph, and it uses a `for` loop to iterate over the nodes in the graph. The `dfs` method is also similar to the original Python code, but it is written in a more Java-like style.

It's worth noting that this code is not the most efficient way to solve the problem, and it may not be the most readable. The original Python code is more concise and efficient, but it may be more difficult for a Java programmer to understand.
