The given Python code is a solution to a problem that involves finding the maximum product of a number and its reverse, given a range of numbers. The code uses a decorator function to define a new function that takes two arguments, `s` and `variable_1_7`, and returns the result of raising `variable_1_7` to the power of `s`. The decorator function is then used to decorate the new function, which is then called with the arguments `s` and `variable_1_7`.

To translate this code to Java, we can use a similar approach. We can define a new function that takes two arguments, `s` and `variable_1_7`, and returns the result of raising `variable_1_7` to the power of `s`. We can then use this function to calculate the maximum product of a number and its reverse, given a range of numbers.

Here is an example of how this could be done in Java:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MaxProduct {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int l = scanner.nextInt();
        int r = scanner.nextInt();
        int curr = r;
        int s = 0;
        while (curr > 0) {
            s++;
            curr /= 10;
        }
        int variable_1_7 = 10;
        int first = powerOfTen(s, variable_1_7);
        int second = first / 2;
        int maxProduct = -1;
        for (int i = l; i <= r; i++) {
            int rev = 0;
            while (i > 0) {
                rev = (rev * 10) + (i % 10);
                i /= 10;
            }
            maxProduct = Math.max(maxProduct, rev * i);
        }
        System.out.println(maxProduct);
    }

    private static int powerOfTen(int s, int variable_1_7) {
        int result = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < s; i++) {
            result *= variable_1_7;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
This code defines a new function `powerOfTen` that takes two arguments, `s` and `variable_1_7`, and returns the result of raising `variable_1_7` to the power of `s`. It then uses this function to calculate the maximum product of a number and its reverse, given a range of numbers.

The `main` method first prompts the user to enter two integers, `l` and `r`, which represent the range of numbers to consider. It then calculates the number of digits in `r` using a while loop, and uses this value to calculate the maximum product of a number and its reverse, given the range of numbers.

The `powerOfTen` function is defined as a private method, which means that it can only be accessed within the `MaxProduct` class. This is a good practice in Java, as it helps to encapsulate the implementation details of the method and make it easier to understand and maintain the code.
