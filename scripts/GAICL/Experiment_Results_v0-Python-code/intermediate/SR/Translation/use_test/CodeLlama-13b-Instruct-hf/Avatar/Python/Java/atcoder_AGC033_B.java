The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves moving a robot around a board and checking if it can reach a specific location. The code uses a few libraries, including `threading` and `queue`, to handle concurrent execution of the robot's movements.

To translate this code to Java, we can start by creating a new class called `Robot` that will represent the robot and its movements. We can define the following attributes and methods for the `Robot` class:

* `boardHeight`: the height of the board
* `boardWidth`: the width of the board
* `startRow`: the starting row of the robot
* `startCol`: the starting column of the robot
* `endRow`: the ending row of the robot
* `endCol`: the ending column of the robot
* `move(direction)`: a method that takes a direction (either "L", "R", "U", or "D") and moves the robot in that direction
* `canReachEnd()`: a method that checks if the robot can reach the end location

Here is an example implementation of the `Robot` class in Java:
```
public class Robot {
    private int boardHeight;
    private int boardWidth;
    private int startRow;
    private int startCol;
    private int endRow;
    private int endCol;

    public Robot(int boardHeight, int boardWidth, int startRow, int startCol, int endRow, int endCol) {
        this.boardHeight = boardHeight;
        this.boardWidth = boardWidth;
        this.startRow = startRow;
        this.startCol = startCol;
        this.endRow = endRow;
        this.endCol = endCol;
    }

    public void move(String direction) {
        switch (direction) {
            case "L":
                startCol--;
                break;
            case "R":
                startCol++;
                break;
            case "U":
                startRow--;
                break;
            case "D":
                startRow++;
                break;
        }
    }

    public boolean canReachEnd() {
        return startRow == endRow && startCol == endCol;
    }
}
```
Next, we can create a new class called `RobotMover` that will handle the concurrent execution of the robot's movements. We can define the following attributes and methods for the `RobotMover` class:

* `robot`: a `Robot` object that represents the robot
* `board`: a 2D array that represents the board
* `startRow`: the starting row of the robot
* `startCol`: the starting column of the robot
* `endRow`: the ending row of the robot
* `endCol`: the ending column of the robot
* `move(direction)`: a method that takes a direction (either "L", "R", "U", or "D") and moves the robot in that direction
* `canReachEnd()`: a method that checks if the robot can reach the end location

Here is an example implementation of the `RobotMover` class in Java:
```
public class RobotMover {
    private Robot robot;
    private int[][] board;
    private int startRow;
    private int startCol;
    private int endRow;
    private int endCol;

    public RobotMover(Robot robot, int[][] board, int startRow, int startCol, int endRow, int endCol) {
        this.robot = robot;
        this.board = board;
        this.startRow = startRow;
        this.startCol = startCol;
        this.endRow = endRow;
        this.endCol = endCol;
    }

    public void move(String direction) {
        robot.move(direction);
    }

    public boolean canReachEnd() {
        return robot.canReachEnd();
    }
}
```
Finally, we can create a new class called `RobotSolver` that will handle the solution to the problem. We can define the following attributes and methods for the `RobotSolver` class:

* `robotMover`: a `RobotMover` object that represents the robot's movements
* `board`: a 2D array that represents the board
* `startRow`: the starting row of the robot
* `startCol`: the starting column of the robot
* `endRow`: the ending row of the robot
* `endCol`: the ending column of the robot
* `solve()`: a method that solves the problem and returns the solution

Here is an example implementation of the `RobotSolver` class in Java:
```
public class RobotSolver {
    private RobotMover robotMover;
    private int[][] board;
    private int startRow;
    private int startCol;
    private int endRow;
    private int endCol;

    public RobotSolver(RobotMover robotMover, int[][] board, int startRow, int startCol, int endRow, int endCol) {
        this.robotMover = robotMover;
        this.board = board;
        this.startRow = startRow;
        this.startCol = startCol;
        this.endRow = endRow;
        this.endCol = endCol;
    }

    public String solve() {
        robotMover.move("L");
        robotMover.move("R");
        robotMover.move("U");
        robotMover.move("D");
        return robotMover.canReachEnd() ? "YES" : "NO";
    }
}
```
To use the `RobotSolver` class, we can create a new instance of it and call the `solve()` method to get the solution to the problem. Here is an example usage of the `RobotSolver` class:
```
int[][] board = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
RobotMover robotMover = new RobotMover(new Robot(3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2), board, 0, 0, 2, 2);
RobotSolver robotSolver = new RobotSolver(robotMover, board, 0, 0, 2, 2);
String solution = robotSolver.solve();
System.out.println(solution);
```
This code will create a new `RobotSolver` object and call the `solve()` method to get the solution to the problem. The solution will be printed to the console.
