The provided Python code is using the `threading` and `queue` modules to perform concurrent computations. The code is also using the `scipy.stats` module to perform statistical calculations.

To translate this code to Java, we can use the `java.util.concurrent` package to perform concurrent computations. We can also use the `java.util.Queue` class to implement the queue data structure.

Here is an example of how the code could be translated to Java:
```
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a queue to store the results
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        // Create a lock to synchronize access to the queue
        Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

        // Create an executor service to run the tasks concurrently
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        // Create a task to calculate the difference
        Future<Integer> task1 = executor.submit(() -> {
            // Acquire the lock to ensure exclusive access to the queue
            lock.lock();
            try {
                // Calculate the difference and add it to the queue
                int result = calculateDifference(queue);
                queue.add(result);
            } finally {
                // Release the lock
                lock.unlock();
            }
        });

        // Create a task to calculate the remainder
        Future<Integer> task2 = executor.submit(() -> {
            // Acquire the lock to ensure exclusive access to the queue
            lock.lock();
            try {
                // Calculate the remainder and add it to the queue
                int result = calculateRemainder(queue);
                queue.add(result);
            } finally {
                // Release the lock
                lock.unlock();
            }
        });

        // Wait for the tasks to complete
        try {
            task1.get();
            task2.get();
        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Print the results
        System.out.println(queue.poll());
    }

    private static int calculateDifference(Queue<Integer> queue) {
        // Calculate the difference and return it
        return queue.poll() - queue.poll();
    }

    private static int calculateRemainder(Queue<Integer> queue) {
        // Calculate the remainder and return it
        return queue.poll() % 1440;
    }
}
```
In this example, we create a `Queue` object to store the results of the calculations. We also create a `Lock` object to synchronize access to the queue.

We then create an `ExecutorService` object to run the tasks concurrently. We create two tasks, one to calculate the difference and one to calculate the remainder. Each task is submitted to the executor service and the results are added to the queue.

We then wait for the tasks to complete and print the results.

Note that this is just one possible way to translate the Python code to Java. There are many other ways to do it, and the specific implementation will depend on the requirements of the application.
