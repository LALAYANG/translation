The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several concepts that are not commonly used in Java programming. However, I can provide a high-level overview of the code and explain how it works.

The code first imports several modules, including `threading`, `queue`, and `scipy.stats`. It then defines a function called `add_to_total` that takes two arguments, `A` and `total`, and returns the sum of `A` and `total`.

The code then defines a function called `ttest_ind` that takes two arguments, `A` and `G`, and returns the result of a statistical test.

The main part of the code starts with a loop that iterates `num_rounds` times. Each iteration of the loop reads two integers `A` and `G` from the input, and then checks if the sum of `A` and `total` is less than or equal to 500. If it is, the code adds `A` to `total` and appends the string `'A'` to a list called `operations`. If it is not, the code subtracts `G` from `total` and appends the string `'G'` to the list.

The code then prints the contents of the `operations` list as a string.

In terms of Java, the code would need to be rewritten to use Java's built-in threading and queue classes, as well as any necessary libraries for statistical analysis. The code would also need to be refactored to use Java's syntax and conventions.
