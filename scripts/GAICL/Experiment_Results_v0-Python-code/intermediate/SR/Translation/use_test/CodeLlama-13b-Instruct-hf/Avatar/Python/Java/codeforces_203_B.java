The given Python code is a solution to a problem that involves finding the first occurrence of a pattern in a grid. The code uses a decorator function `my_decorator` to wrap the `solve_case` function, which is the main function that solves the problem.

The `solve_case` function first takes in two inputs `newn_1` and `m` from the user, which represent the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively. It then initializes a 2D list `newcount_1` with `newn_1` rows and `newn_1` columns, and sets all the elements to 0.

The function then defines a nested function `Func_loop_4_4_0` that takes in three inputs `i`, `stop`, and `step`. This function is used to initialize the `newcount_1` list by setting all the elements to 0.

The main logic of the `solve_case` function is to iterate over the `m` inputs from the user, and for each input, it finds the first occurrence of the pattern in the grid. The pattern is represented by a 3x3 square of 1s, and the function checks if the square is present in the grid. If the square is present, it increments the corresponding elements in the `newcount_1` list by 1.

If the square is not present, the function sets the `found` variable to `False`. If the `found` variable is `True`, the function sets the `ans` variable to the current value of `k` (which represents the current iteration number), and breaks out of the loop.

Finally, the function prints the value of `ans` to the console.

Here is the equivalent Java code for the `solve_case` function:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SolveCase {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int newn_1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        int[][] newcount_1 = new int[newn_1][newn_1];

        for (int i = 0; i < newn_1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < newn_1; j++) {
                newcount_1[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }

        for (int k = 0; k < m; k++) {
            int x = scanner.nextInt();
            int y = scanner.nextInt();
            boolean found = false;

            for (int i = x - 2; i <= x + 1; i++) {
                for (int j = y - 2; j <= y + 1; j++) {
                    if (i >= 0 && i < newn_1 && j >= 0 && j < newn_1) {
                        newcount_1[i][j]++;
                        if (newcount_1[i][j] == 9) {
                            found = true;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

            if (found) {
                System.out.println(k + 1);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Note that the Java code uses a `Scanner` object to read input from the console, and it uses a 2D array `newcount_1` to represent the grid. The `main` function first takes in two inputs `newn_1` and `m` from the user, and it initializes the `newcount_1` array with `newn_1` rows and `newn_1` columns, and sets all the elements to 0.

The main logic of the `main` function is similar to the Python code, it iterates over the `m` inputs from the user, and for each input, it finds the first occurrence of the pattern in the grid. The pattern is represented by a 3x3 square of 1s, and the function checks if the square is present in the grid. If the square is present, it increments the corresponding elements in the `newcount_1` array by 1.

If the square is not present, the function sets the `found` variable to `false`. If the `found` variable is `true`, the function prints the current value of `k` (which represents the current iteration number) to the console, and breaks out of the loop.

Finally, the function prints the value of `ans` to the console.
