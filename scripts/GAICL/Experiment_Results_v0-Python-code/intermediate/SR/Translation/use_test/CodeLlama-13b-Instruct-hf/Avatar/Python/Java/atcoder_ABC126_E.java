The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves finding the number of connected components in a graph. The code uses a decorator function to read input from the standard input, and then it uses a deque to implement a breadth-first search algorithm to find the connected components in the graph.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Deque;
import java.util.ArrayDeque;

public class ConnectedComponents {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int M = scanner.nextInt();
        int[][] edge = new int[N][N];
        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            int X = scanner.nextInt();
            int Y = scanner.nextInt();
            int Z = scanner.nextInt();
            edge[X][Y] = Z;
            edge[Y][X] = Z;
        }
        boolean[] used = new boolean[N];
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (used[i]) {
                continue;
            }
            Deque<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
            queue.add(i);
            while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                int node = queue.removeFirst();
                used[node] = true;
                for (int nextnode : edge[node]) {
                    if (!used[nextnode]) {
                        queue.add(nextnode);
                    }
                }
            }
            ans++;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```
This code uses a similar approach as the Python code, but it uses Java's built-in data structures and algorithms to implement the breadth-first search algorithm. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the standard input, and the `Deque` class is used to implement the queue data structure. The `ArrayDeque` class is used to implement the deque data structure.

The `main` method first reads the input from the standard input using the `Scanner` class. It then creates an adjacency matrix `edge` to represent the graph, and a boolean array `used` to keep track of which nodes have been visited.

The `main` method then iterates over the nodes in the graph using a for loop, and for each node, it checks if it has been visited using the `used` array. If the node has not been visited, it adds it to the queue and marks it as visited using the `used` array.

The `main` method then iterates over the nodes in the queue using a while loop, and for each node, it checks if it has any unvisited neighbors. If it has any unvisited neighbors, it adds them to the queue and marks them as visited using the `used` array.

The `main` method then increments the `ans` variable by 1 for each node in the queue, which represents the number of connected components in the graph. Finally, the `main` method prints the `ans` variable to the standard output.

Note that the `main` method uses a similar approach as the Python code, but it uses Java's built-in data structures and algorithms to implement the breadth-first search algorithm. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the standard input, and the `Deque` class is used to implement the queue data structure. The `ArrayDeque` class is used to implement the deque data structure.
