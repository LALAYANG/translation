The given Python code is a solution to the "Triplet Sum" problem, which is a classic problem in computer science. The problem statement is as follows:

Given an array of integers, find three elements in the array such that the sum of the three elements is equal to a given number.

The Python code first defines a function called `sum_two` that takes two integers as input and returns their sum. It then defines a decorator called `my_decorator` that takes a function as input and returns a new function that is a decorator of the original function. The decorator shuffles the input array and then calls the original function with the shuffled array as input.

The main part of the code then defines a function called `find_triplet` that takes three arguments: `k`, `stop`, and `step`. The function first checks if the step is zero or if the current index `k` is greater than or equal to the stop index, and if so, it returns. Otherwise, it checks if the current element at index `k` is not equal to the elements at indices `i` and `j`, and if the sum of the current element and the elements at indices `i` and `j` is equal to the given number. If so, it prints the indices of the three elements and exits the program. Otherwise, it calls itself recursively with the next index `k + step` and the same stop index and step.

The code then takes input from the user, shuffles the input array, and then calls the `find_triplet` function with the shuffled array as input. If the function finds a triplet that satisfies the condition, it prints the indices of the three elements and exits the program. Otherwise, it prints -1.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TripletSum {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int[] numbers = Arrays.stream(scanner.nextLine().split(" ")).mapToInt(Integer::parseInt).toArray();
        int target = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.close();

        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
                for (int k = j + 1; k < numbers.length; k++) {
                    if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] + numbers[k] == target) {
                        System.out.println(i + 1 + " " + j + 1 + " " + k + 1);
                        return;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(-1);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `Arrays` class to convert the input string into an array of integers. It then uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible combinations of three elements in the array, and checks if their sum is equal to the target number. If a match is found, it prints the indices of the three elements and exits the program. Otherwise, it prints -1.

Note that this code assumes that the input array is sorted in ascending order. If the input array is not sorted, you will need to sort it before using the nested loop to find the triplet.
