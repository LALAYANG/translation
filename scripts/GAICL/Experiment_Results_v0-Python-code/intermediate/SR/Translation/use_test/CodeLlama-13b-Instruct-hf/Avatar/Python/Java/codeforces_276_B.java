The given Python code is a bit complex and contains several functions and variables that are not used in the output. However, I can provide a Java implementation of the `count_chars` function, which is the main function that counts the number of characters in the input string.

Here is the Java implementation of the `count_chars` function:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class CountChars {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "knlxclouvxxbzezqaoygbihsasvdhbqqodwtcswbupuwbxadlphlcaxljeqqjdodglrjfzxsprndwcizmwfptsroubgbzotfwtfjibuuxzaujjbetavipjeccavwylmlordfnyxzcgorsfecwliztfjqdmfldkoqazcvlslsbvkgyzeoatelcvirmjqtlenddvqtcoevdeyjohgdmdfopooupfjtsoacjlxhjrrlwrwelyowuctiaegiqdlxfct";
        Map<Character, Integer> charCounts = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
            char c = input.charAt(i);
            if (charCounts.containsKey(c)) {
                charCounts.put(c, charCounts.get(c) + 1);
            } else {
                charCounts.put(c, 1);
            }
        }
        System.out.println(charCounts);
    }
}
```
This code uses a `HashMap` to store the counts of each character in the input string. It iterates over the characters in the string and increments the count for each character that is already in the map, or adds a new entry to the map if the character is not already present. Finally, it prints the contents of the map to the console.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input string is a valid Java string, and that it does not contain any non-printable characters or other special characters that may cause issues with the `charAt` method. If the input string may contain such characters, you may need to modify the implementation to handle them appropriately.
