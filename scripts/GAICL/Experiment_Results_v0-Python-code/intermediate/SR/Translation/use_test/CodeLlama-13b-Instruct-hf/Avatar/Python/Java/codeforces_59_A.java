The provided Python code is using multithreading to count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in a string. The code is using the `threading` module to create two threads, one for counting the uppercase letters and one for counting the lowercase letters. Each thread is using a `queue` to communicate with the main thread and return the result.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class UpperLowerCounter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = args[0];
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        Future<Integer> upperCountFuture = executor.submit(() -> countUppercase(input));
        Future<Integer> lowerCountFuture = executor.submit(() -> countLowercase(input));
        int upperCount = upperCountFuture.get();
        int lowerCount = lowerCountFuture.get();
        executor.shutdown();
        if (upperCount > lowerCount) {
            System.out.println(input.toUpperCase());
        } else {
            System.out.println(input.toLowerCase());
        }
    }

    private static int countUppercase(String input) {
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : input.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isUpperCase(c)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private static int countLowercase(String input) {
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : input.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLowerCase(c)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
This code uses the `ExecutorService` class from the `java.util.concurrent` package to create a thread pool with two threads. The `submit` method is used to submit the `countUppercase` and `countLowercase` methods to the thread pool, which will execute them concurrently. The `get` method is used to retrieve the results of the two methods, and the `shutdown` method is used to shut down the thread pool.

The `countUppercase` and `countLowercase` methods are similar to the Python code, they iterate over the characters of the input string and count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters respectively.

The main method then compares the two counts and prints the input string in uppercase or lowercase depending on which count is greater.

Note that this code is not exactly equivalent to the Python code, as it does not use the `queue` class to communicate between the threads, but it should give you an idea of how to implement multithreading in Java.
