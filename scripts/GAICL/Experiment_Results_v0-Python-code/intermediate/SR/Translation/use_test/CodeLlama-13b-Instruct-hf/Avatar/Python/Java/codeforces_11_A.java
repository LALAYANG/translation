The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several functions and decorators. However, I can provide a semantically equivalent Java code that implements the same logic.

Here is the Java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] x = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            x[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int m = 0;
        int q = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (x[i] >= x[i + 1]) {
                q = (int) Math.ceil((x[i] - x[i + 1]) / d);
                m += q;
                x[i + 1] += q * d;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(m);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read the input from the user, and then it implements the logic of the program. It first reads the values of `n` and `d` from the input, and then it reads the values of `x` from the input. It then initializes the variables `m` and `q` to 0.

The code then iterates over the values of `x` and checks if the current value is greater than or equal to the next value. If it is, it calculates the value of `q` and updates the value of `m` and `x[i + 1]`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `m` to the console.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
