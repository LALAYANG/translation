The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several features that are not commonly used in Java programming. However, I can provide a Java implementation of the core logic of the program.

Here is a semantically equivalent Java program that implements the same logic as the Python code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int initialConditionValue = 353;
        int conditionCheckValue = 800;
        String ip = scanner.nextLine();
        ttest_ind([17, 39, 50], [83, 25, 18]);
        String st = "";
        if (initialConditionValue & conditionCheckValue) {
            if (ip.length() != 1) {
                if (ip.charAt(0) == '9') {
                    st = "9";
                    ip = ip.substring(1);
                }
                int maxLoopCount = 953;
                int loopIncrement = 952;

                for (int i = 0; i < maxLoopCount / loopIncrement; i++) {
                    for (int j = 0; j < ip.length(); j++) {
                        int digit = Integer.parseInt(ip.charAt(j));
                        if (digit > 4) {
                            int complementDigit = 9 - digit;
                            st += String.valueOf(complementDigit);
                        } else {
                            st += ip.charAt(j);
                        }
                    }
                }
            } else {
                st = ip;
            }
            System.out.println(Integer.parseInt(st));
        }
    }
}
```
This program uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `ttest_ind` function is not implemented in Java. The `ttest_ind` function is a statistical function that is not commonly used in Java programming.

The core logic of the program is similar to the Python code, with some minor differences in syntax and the use of Java's built-in `String` and `Integer` classes. The program reads input from the user, checks the length of the input, and then processes the input based on the length. If the input is not a single digit, the program processes the input by iterating over each digit and checking if it is greater than 4. If it is, the program calculates the complement of the digit and adds it to the output string. If the input is a single digit, the program simply adds the digit to the output string. Finally, the program prints the output string as an integer.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
