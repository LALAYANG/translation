The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves reading a single character from the user, finding the next character in the alphabet, and printing the result. The code uses several concepts from Python, including functions, queues, threads, and decorators.

To translate this code to Java, we need to replace the Python syntax with Java syntax. Here's an example of how the code could be translated:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.concurrent.Thread;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Queue<Character> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            char c = scanner.next().charAt(0);
            queue.add(c);
        });
        thread.start();

        char result = queue.poll();
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```
In this example, we use the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `Queue` class to store the result. We create a new thread to read the input and add it to the queue, and then we poll the queue to get the result. Finally, we print the result to the console.

Note that this is just one possible way to translate the Python code to Java, and there may be other ways to do it as well.
