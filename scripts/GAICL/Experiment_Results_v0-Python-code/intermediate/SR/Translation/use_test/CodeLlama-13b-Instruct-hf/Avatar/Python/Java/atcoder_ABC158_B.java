The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves calculating the number of ways to distribute a set of items among a set of people, subject to certain constraints. The code uses the `scipy.stats` library to perform a t-test on the input data, and then uses the `numpy` library to perform mathematical operations on the data.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int limit_b = scanner.nextInt();
        int ans = 0;
        int rep = N / (A + limit_b);
        ans += rep * A;
        int res = N - rep * (A + limit_b);
        ans += Math.min(res, A);
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `Math` class to perform mathematical operations. The `Arrays` and `IntStream` classes are used to perform operations on arrays of integers.

The code first reads the input data from the user, and then calculates the number of ways to distribute the items among the people, subject to the constraints. The `ans` variable is used to store the final result, and the `rep` variable is used to store the number of repetitions of the distribution. The `res` variable is used to store the remaining items after the distribution, and the `Math.min` method is used to find the minimum of the `res` and `A` variables.

Finally, the `System.out.println` method is used to print the final result to the console.
