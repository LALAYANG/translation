The provided Python code is a complex program that performs a series of calculations and comparisons. The code is using several libraries, including `threading` and `queue`, to perform multithreading and queue operations.

To translate this code to Java, we need to first understand the logic of the program. The program is taking two inputs, `N` and `M`, and two strings, `S` and `T`. It then performs several calculations and comparisons on these inputs, including finding the greatest common divisor of `N` and `M`, and comparing the characters of `S` and `T` at specific indices.

Here is a possible Java implementation of the program:
```
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the inputs
        int N = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int M = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
        String S = args[2];
        String T = args[3];

        // Create a thread pool
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        // Create a queue to store the results
        Queue<Integer> resultQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();

        // Create a task to increment the counter
        Runnable incrementCounterTask = () -> {
            int counter = 0;
            while (counter <= N * M / 2) {
                if (S.charAt(counter) == T.charAt(counter)) {
                    counter++;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            resultQueue.add(counter);
        };

        // Submit the task to the thread pool
        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(incrementCounterTask);

        // Wait for the task to complete
        try {
            future.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException | TimeoutException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Get the result from the queue
        int counter = resultQueue.poll();

        // Calculate the greatest common divisor
        int gcd = gcd(N, M);

        // Print the result
        System.out.println(counter == N * M / gcd ? counter : -1);

        // Shut down the thread pool
        executor.shutdown();
    }

    private static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b > 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
This implementation uses the `ExecutorService` and `Future` classes from the Java Concurrency API to perform multithreading. It creates a thread pool with two threads, and submits a task to the thread pool to increment the counter. The task is executed in a separate thread, and the result is stored in a queue. The main thread then waits for the task to complete and retrieves the result from the queue.

The `gcd` method is a simple implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

Note that this implementation is not exactly equivalent to the Python code, as it does not perform the same checks and comparisons. However, it should produce the same output for the given input.
