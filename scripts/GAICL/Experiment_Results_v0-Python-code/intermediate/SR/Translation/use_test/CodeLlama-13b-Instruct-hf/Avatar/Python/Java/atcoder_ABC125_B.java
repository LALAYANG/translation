The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several features that are not commonly used in Java programming. However, I can provide a Java implementation of the core logic of the program, which is the recursive function that computes the sum of the elements in the list.

Here is the Java implementation:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class RecursiveSum {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        int numItems = 4;
        int[] V = {13, 21, 6, 19};
        int[] costs = {11, 30, 6, 15};
        int ans = 0;
        int X = 0;
        int Y = 0;
        int CONDITION_1 = 340;
        int CONDITION_2 = 460;
        int LOOP_END_1 = 638;
        int LOOP_END_2 = 637;

        for (int LoopIndexOut = 0; LoopIndexOut < LOOP_END_1 / LOOP_END_2; LoopIndexOut++) {
            recursiveSum(list, 0, numItems, 1);
        }

        System.out.println(list.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum());
    }

    private static void recursiveSum(List<Integer> list, int itemIndex, int stop, int step) {
        if (step == 0 || (step > 0 && itemIndex >= stop) || (step < 0 && itemIndex <= stop)) {
            return;
        }

        if (CONDITION_1 & CONDITION_2) {
            if (V[itemIndex] - costs[itemIndex] > 0) {
                X = V[itemIndex];
                Y = costs[itemIndex];
                list.add(X - Y);
            }
        }

        recursiveSum(list, itemIndex + step, stop, step);
    }
}
```
This implementation uses a recursive function to compute the sum of the elements in the list. The function takes four arguments: the list to be summed, the current item index, the stop index, and the step size. The function first checks if the current item index is within the range of the list, and if the step size is non-zero. If both conditions are met, the function checks if the current item is greater than the stop index, and if the current item is greater than the stop index, it adds the current item to the list. Finally, the function calls itself recursively with the updated item index and step size.

The main method first initializes the list, the number of items, the V array, the costs array, and the loop end indices. It then iterates over the loop end indices and calls the recursiveSum function with the initial item index, stop index, and step size. Finally, it prints the sum of the elements in the list.

Note that this implementation is not exactly equivalent to the Python code, as it does not use the same data structures or algorithms. However, it should provide a similar result for the given input.
