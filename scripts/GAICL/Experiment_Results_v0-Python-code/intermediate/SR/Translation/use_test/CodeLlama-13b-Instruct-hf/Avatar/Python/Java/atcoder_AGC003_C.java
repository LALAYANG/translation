The given Python code is a bit complex and contains several concepts that are not commonly used in Java programming. However, I will try my best to provide a Java solution that is equivalent to the given Python code.

First, let's start by defining the `my_decorator` function, which is a decorator that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that wraps the original function. In Java, we can achieve a similar effect by using a lambda expression.
```java
Function<Integer, Integer> my_decorator(Function<Integer, Integer> func) {
    return (Integer element, Integer N, Integer variable_3_9) -> {
        Integer res = func.apply(element, N, variable_3_9);
        return res;
    };
}
```
Next, let's define the `calculate_remainder` function, which takes three arguments: `element`, `N`, and `variable_3_9`. This function calculates the remainder of `element` divided by `N` and then modulo `variable_3_9`. In Java, we can achieve a similar effect by using the `%` operator.
```java
Function<Integer, Integer> calculate_remainder(Integer element, Integer N, Integer variable_3_9) {
    return (Integer res) -> {
        Integer remainder = element % N % variable_3_9;
        return remainder;
    };
}
```
Now, let's define the `worker_thread` function, which takes a `result_queue` as an argument and returns a new thread that calculates the remainder of `element` divided by `N` and then modulo `variable_3_9`. In Java, we can achieve a similar effect by using the `Thread` class.
```java
Thread worker_thread(Queue<Integer> result_queue) {
    return new Thread(() -> {
        Integer element = A[i];
        Integer variable_3_9 = 2;
        Integer result = calculate_remainder(element, N, variable_3_9).apply(element, N, variable_3_9);
        result_queue.put(result);
    });
}
```
Finally, let's define the `main` function, which takes no arguments and returns nothing. This function reads the input from the user, sorts the input array, and then calculates the remainder of each element divided by `N` and then modulo `variable_3_9`. It then prints the result.
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    int N = scanner.nextInt();
    int[] A = new int[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        A[i] = scanner.nextInt();
    }
    Arrays.sort(A);
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int element = A[i];
        int variable_3_9 = 2;
        Queue<Integer> result_queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Thread worker_thread = worker_thread(result_queue);
        worker_thread.start();
        worker_thread.join();
        int result = result_queue.get();
        int remainder = result;
        if (remainder % 2 != i % 2) {
            cnt = cnt + 1;
        }
    }
    System.out.println(cnt / 2);
}
```
Note that this Java code is not exactly equivalent to the given Python code, as it uses different data structures and algorithms. However, it should produce the same output for the given input.
