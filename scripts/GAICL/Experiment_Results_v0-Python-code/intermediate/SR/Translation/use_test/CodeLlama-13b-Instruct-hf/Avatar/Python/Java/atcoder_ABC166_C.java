The provided Python code is using the `scipy.stats` library to perform a t-test on two sets of data. The code is also using the `shuffle` function from the `sklearn.utils` library to shuffle the data.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] p = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            p[i] = i + 1;
        }
        int[] health = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            health[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        Map<Integer, Integer> healthPoints = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            healthPoints.put(p[i], health[i]);
        }
        int[] path = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            path[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int a = path[i];
            int b = path[i + 1];
            if (healthPoints.get(a) <= healthPoints.get(b)) {
                c++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `HashMap` class to store the health points of each node. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate over the path and check if the health points of each node are less than or equal to the health points of its neighbor. If they are, the `c` variable is incremented. Finally, the `c` variable is printed to the console.

Note that the `shuffle` function is not used in this code, as it is not necessary to shuffle the data in this case.
