The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several concepts that are not commonly used in Java programming. However, I will try my best to provide a Java solution that is semantically equivalent to the Python code.

Here is my attempt at translating the Python code to Java:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int iterations = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(iterations, iterations, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<>());
        Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

        for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
            int n = Integer.parseInt(args[i + 1]);
            executor.execute(() -> {
                lock.lock();
                try {
                    int variable_3_13 = 2;
                    int variable_7_13 = 1;
                    int result = (variable_7_13 + n) * n / variable_3_13;
                    System.out.println(result);
                } finally {
                    lock.unlock();
                }
            });
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class from the `java.util.concurrent` package to create a thread pool with a fixed number of threads equal to the number of iterations. Each thread is responsible for computing the result for a single iteration. The `Lock` class from the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package is used to ensure that only one thread can access the shared variables at a time.

The `main` method takes the number of iterations as an argument and creates a thread pool with that many threads. It then loops over the input arguments, starting a new thread for each iteration. Each thread computes the result for its iteration and prints it to the console.

Note that this code is not exactly equivalent to the Python code, as it does not use the `shuffle` function from the `sklearn.utils` module. However, it should produce the same output for the given input.
