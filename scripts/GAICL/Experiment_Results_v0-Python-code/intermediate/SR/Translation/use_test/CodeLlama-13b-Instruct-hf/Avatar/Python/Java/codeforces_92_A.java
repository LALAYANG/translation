The provided Python code is a complex program that uses decorators, threads, and queues to perform a calculation. The program is semantically equivalent to the following Java code:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.Thread;
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue;

public class Calculation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 29;
        int m = 7772;
        int value = 318;
        int result = 0;

        while (m >= n) {
            m -= n;
            value = 1;
            BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();

            Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
                int newResult = calculateResult(n, value);
                queue.put(newResult);
            });

            thread.start();
            thread.join();

            result = queue.take();
            n = result;
        }

        System.out.println(m);
    }

    private static int calculateResult(int n, int value) {
        return n % value + value;
    }
}
```
In this Java code, we have defined a `Calculation` class with a `main` method that takes two integer arguments `n` and `m`. We have also defined a `calculateResult` method that takes two integer arguments `n` and `value` and returns the result of the calculation.

In the `main` method, we have defined a `while` loop that iterates until `m` is greater than or equal to `n`. Inside the loop, we have defined a `BlockingQueue` to store the result of the calculation. We have also defined a `Thread` that runs the `calculateResult` method and puts the result in the queue.

We have then started the thread and joined it, which means that the thread will run in parallel with the main thread and will put the result in the queue. We have then taken the result from the queue and assigned it to the `result` variable.

Finally, we have printed the value of `m` to the console.

Note that this is a simplified version of the original Python code, and it may not produce the same results as the original code. The original code uses decorators and other advanced features of Python that are not present in Java.
