The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves finding the minimum value of a function that is defined as the sum of the products of two arrays. The code first takes in two inputs, `N` and `K`, which represent the size of the arrays and the target value, respectively. It then takes in `N` more inputs, which represent the elements of the two arrays.

The code then sorts the elements of the two arrays and defines a variable `ll` to be the minimum value of the function, and a variable `rr` to be the maximum value of the function. It then enters a loop that iterates until `ll + 1 < rr`.

In each iteration of the loop, the code checks if the current value of `x` satisfies the condition that the sum of the products of the two arrays is less than or equal to `K`. If it does, it updates `ll` to be `x`. If it doesn't, it updates `rr` to be `x`.

After the loop, the code prints the value of `ll`, which is the minimum value of the function that satisfies the condition.

To translate this code to Java, we can use the same logic and data structures. Here is an example implementation:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int K = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] A = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            A[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        Arrays.sort(A);
        int ll = -1000000000;
        int rr = 1000000000;
        while (ll + 1 < rr) {
            int x = (ll + rr) / 2;
            int tot = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                if (A[i] < 0) {
                    int l = -1;
                    int r = N;
                    while (l + 1 < r) {
                        int c = (l + r) / 2;
                        if (A[i] * A[c] < x) {
                            r = c;
                        } else {
                            l = c;
                        }
                    }
                    tot += N - r;
                } else {
                    int l = -1;
                    int r = N;
                    while (l + 1 < r) {
                        int c = (l + r) / 2;
                        if (A[i] * A[c] < x) {
                            l = c;
                        } else {
                            r = c;
                        }
                    }
                    tot = tot + r;
                }
                if (A[i] * A[i] < x) {
                    tot -= 1;
                }
            }
            tot /= 2;
            if (tot < K) {
                ll = x;
            } else {
                rr = x;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ll);
    }
}
```
This implementation uses the same logic as the Python code, but it uses Java data structures and algorithms to perform the calculations. The `Arrays.sort()` method is used to sort the elements of the two arrays, and the `while` loop is used to iterate until the minimum value of the function is found. The `if` statements are used to check if the current value of `x` satisfies the condition that the sum of the products of the two arrays is less than or equal to `K`. If it does, the value of `ll` is updated to be `x`. If it doesn't, the value of `rr` is updated to be `x`.

After the loop, the value of `ll` is printed, which is the minimum value of the function that satisfies the condition.
