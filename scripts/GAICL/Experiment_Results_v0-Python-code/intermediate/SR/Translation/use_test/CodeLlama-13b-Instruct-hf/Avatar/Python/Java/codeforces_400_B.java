The given Python code is a bit complex and contains several functions and decorators. However, I can provide a high-level overview of the code and help you translate it to Java.

The code defines several functions, including `diff_calc_level1`, `diff_calc_level2`, `diff_calc_level3`, and `diff_calc_level4`. These functions are used to calculate the difference between two values.

The code also defines a decorator called `my_decorator` that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that calls the original function and returns its result.

The main function of the code is `calculate_difference`, which takes two arguments, `start_index` and `b`, and calculates the difference between them. The function first shuffles a list of numbers using the `shuffle` function from the `sklearn.utils` module. It then calculates the difference between the two values using the `diff_calc_level2` function.

The code then reads input from the user and calculates the difference between the two values for each line of input. It then prints the result.

To translate this code to Java, you can start by defining the `diff_calc_level1`, `diff_calc_level2`, `diff_calc_level3`, and `diff_calc_level4` functions. You can then define the `my_decorator` function as a method that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that calls the original function and returns its result.

Next, you can define the `calculate_difference` function as a method that takes two arguments, `start_index` and `b`, and calculates the difference between them. You can use the `shuffle` function from the `sklearn.utils` module to shuffle a list of numbers, and then use the `diff_calc_level2` function to calculate the difference between the two values.

Finally, you can read input from the user and calculate the difference between the two values for each line of input. You can then print the result.

Here is an example of how you can translate the code to Java:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CalculateDifference {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int numLines = scanner.nextInt();
        int dummyVar = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.nextLine();

        for (int i = 0; i < numLines; i++) {
            String inputString = scanner.nextLine();
            int startIndex = inputString.indexOf("S");
            int endIndex = inputString.indexOf("G");
            int difference = calculateDifference(startIndex, endIndex);
            System.out.println(difference);
        }
    }

    public static int calculateDifference(int startIndex, int endIndex) {
        return startIndex - endIndex;
    }
}
```
This code defines a `CalculateDifference` class that contains the `main` method, which reads input from the user and calculates the difference between the two values for each line of input. It also defines a `calculateDifference` method that calculates the difference between the two values.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
