The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves finding the intersection of two intervals. The code first reads in two integers `l` and `r` representing the lower and upper bounds of the first interval, respectively. It then reads in a series of pairs of integers representing the lower and upper bounds of the second interval, and checks if the two intervals intersect. If they do, the code prints the index of the intersection, otherwise it prints -1.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Intersection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int l = sc.nextInt();
        int r = sc.nextInt();
        int intersectionId = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int li = sc.nextInt();
            int ri = sc.nextInt();
            if (li <= l && r <= ri) {
                intersectionId = i;
            } else if (li < l || r < ri) {
                intersectionId = n;
            }
            l = Math.min(l, li);
            r = Math.max(r, ri);
        }
        System.out.println(intersectionId == n ? -1 : intersectionId + 1);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read in the input from the user, and the `Math` class to perform the necessary calculations. The `for` loop iterates over the input pairs of integers, and the `if` statements check if the two intervals intersect. If they do, the code updates the `intersectionId` variable to the current index. If the two intervals do not intersect, the code sets `intersectionId` to `n`. Finally, the code prints the result.

Note that the provided Python code uses a decorator to define a function that performs the intersection check. This is not necessary in Java, as the code can be written directly in the `main` method.
