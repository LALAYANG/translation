The provided Python code is a complex program that uses various libraries and techniques, including decorators, queues, and multithreading. The program is trying to solve a problem related to finding the minimum number of operations required to transform a given array of integers into a sorted array.

To translate this program to Java, we would need to rewrite the code using Java syntax and libraries. Here is a possible implementation:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class MinimumOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] a = {4, 61, 26};
        int x = 100;
        int ans = 0;

        // Sort the array
        Arrays.sort(a);

        // Create a queue to store the results of the calculations
        Queue<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();

        // Create a thread pool to perform the calculations
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Loop through the array and perform the calculations
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            int currentValue = a[i];
            if (currentValue > x) {
                x = 0;
                break;
            }
            queue.add(currentValue);
            executor.submit(() -> {
                int result = x - currentValue;
                queue.add(result);
            });
        }

        // Wait for all the calculations to complete
        executor.shutdown();
        try {
            executor.awaitTermination(Long.MAX_VALUE, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Get the results from the queue and calculate the minimum number of operations
        List<Integer> results = new ArrayList<>(queue);
        int minOperations = results.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();

        // Print the result
        System.out.println(minOperations);
    }
}
```
This implementation uses the `Arrays.sort()` method to sort the array, and the `ExecutorService` class to perform the calculations in parallel. The `Queue` class is used to store the results of the calculations, and the `ArrayList` class is used to store the results in a list. The `stream()` method is used to calculate the minimum number of operations.

Note that this implementation is not exactly equivalent to the Python code, as it does not use the `shuffle()` function to shuffle the array, and it does not perform the `ttest_ind()` function. However, it should give the same result as the Python code for the given input.
