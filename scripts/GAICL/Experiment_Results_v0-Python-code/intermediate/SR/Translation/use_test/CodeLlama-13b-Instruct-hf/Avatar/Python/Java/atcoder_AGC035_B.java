The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves finding a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. The code uses a decorator function to wrap the `calculate_difference` function, which is used to calculate the difference between two variables. The decorator function also includes a `time.sleep(0.18)` statement, which is used to introduce a delay in the execution of the function.

The `calculate_difference` function takes two variables as input and returns their difference. The `my_decorator` function is used to wrap the `calculate_difference` function and add the delay to its execution.

The rest of the code is used to read the input from the user, create a bipartite graph, and find a perfect matching in the graph. The code uses the `heapq` module to implement a priority queue, and the `threading` module to create a new thread for the `calculate_difference` function.

Here is the Java code that is equivalent to the provided Python code:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class PerfectMatching {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Read input from the user
        int numNodes = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int numEdges = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
        int[][] edges = new int[numNodes][numNodes];
        for (int i = 0; i < numEdges; i++) {
            int[] edge = new int[2];
            edge[0] = Integer.parseInt(args[2 * i]);
            edge[1] = Integer.parseInt(args[2 * i + 1]);
            edges[edge[0] - 1][edge[1] - 1] = 1;
            edges[edge[1] - 1][edge[0] - 1] = 1;
        }

        // Create a bipartite graph
        int[] degrees = new int[numNodes];
        for (int i = 0; i < numNodes; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < numNodes; j++) {
                if (edges[i][j] == 1) {
                    degrees[i]++;
                    degrees[j]++;
                }
            }
        }

        // Find a perfect matching in the graph
        int[] parity = new int[numNodes];
        int[] flag = new int[numNodes];
        for (int i = 0; i < numNodes; i++) {
            if (degrees[i] % 2 != 0) {
                System.out.println(-1);
                return;
            }
            for (int j = 0; j < numNodes; j++) {
                if (edges[i][j] == 1) {
                    edges[i][j] = 0;
                    edges[j][i] = 0;
                    degrees[i]--;
                    degrees[j]--;
                    if (parity[i] != 0 && j == 0) {
                        System.out.println(i + 1 + " " + j + 1);
                        int variable3 = parity[i];
                        int variable1 = 1;
                        int result = calculateDifference(variable3, variable1);
                        parity[i] = result;
                    } else {
                        System.out.println(j + 1 + " " + i + 1);
                        parity[j] = 1 - parity[j];
                    }
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static int calculateDifference(int variable3, int variable1) {
        try {
            TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(180);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return variable1 - variable3;
    }
}
```
In this Java code, we have defined a `PerfectMatching` class that contains the `main` method, which is the entry point of the program. The `main` method reads the input from the user, creates a bipartite graph, and finds a perfect matching in the graph.

The `calculateDifference` method is used to calculate the difference between two variables, and it is wrapped in a `try-catch` block to handle the `InterruptedException` that may occur when the thread is interrupted.

The rest of the code is similar to the Python code, with the exception of the `try-catch` block and the `TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(180)` statement, which is used to introduce a delay in the execution of the `calculateDifference` method.

Note that the Java code uses the `Integer.parseInt(args[0])` method to parse the input from the user, which is similar to the `map(int, input().split())` method used in the Python code.
