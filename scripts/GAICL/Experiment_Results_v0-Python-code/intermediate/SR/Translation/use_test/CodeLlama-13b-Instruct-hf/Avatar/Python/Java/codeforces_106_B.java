The provided Python code is a complex program that involves multiple functions, loops, and data structures. To translate it to Java, we need to first understand the logic of the program and then implement it in Java.

The program takes input from the user, which is a list of items, and then performs the following operations:

1. It computes the strength, R, health, and cost of each item.
2. It checks if the item is outdated based on the strength, R, and health of other items in the list.
3. It computes the minimum cost of all the items that are not outdated.
4. It prints the input number of the item with the minimum cost.

Here is a possible implementation of the program in Java:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Item {
    private int strength;
    private int R;
    private int health;
    private int cost;

    public Item(int strength, int R, int health, int cost) {
        this.strength = strength;
        this.R = R;
        this.health = health;
        this.cost = cost;
    }

    public int getStrength() {
        return strength;
    }

    public int getR() {
        return R;
    }

    public int getHealth() {
        return health;
    }

    public int getCost() {
        return cost;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        List<Item> items = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int strength = scanner.nextInt();
            int R = scanner.nextInt();
            int health = scanner.nextInt();
            int cost = scanner.nextInt();
            items.add(new Item(strength, R, health, cost));
        }

        List<Item> outdatedItems = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i != j && items.get(i).getStrength() < items.get(j).getStrength() && items.get(i).getR() < items.get(j).getR() && items.get(i).getHealth() < items.get(j).getHealth()) {
                    outdatedItems.add(items.get(i));
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        int minimumCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int inputNumber = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!outdatedItems.contains(items.get(i)) && items.get(i).getCost() < minimumCost) {
                minimumCost = items.get(i).getCost();
                inputNumber = i + 1;
            }
        }

        System.out.println(inputNumber);
    }
}
```
In this implementation, we first define a class `Item` to represent an item with its strength, R, health, and cost. We then create a list of `Item` objects to store the input items.

Next, we iterate through the list of items and check if each item is outdated based on the strength, R, and health of other items in the list. If an item is outdated, we add it to a list of outdated items.

After that, we iterate through the list of items again and check if each item is not outdated and has a cost that is less than the minimum cost. If an item meets these conditions, we update the minimum cost and the input number of the item.

Finally, we print the input number of the item with the minimum cost.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input is a list of items, each represented by a line of four integers (strength, R, health, and cost). If the input is in a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
