The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves cutting a ribbon into equal pieces. The code uses a decorator function to wrap the main function, which is then called with the input parameters. The decorator function is used to perform some pre-processing tasks before calling the main function.

The main function takes an array of integers as input, which represents the lengths of the ribbon pieces. The function then sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the total length of the ribbon. If the total length is divisible by the length of the first piece, the function prints the number of pieces that can be cut and returns.

Otherwise, the function calculates the number of pieces that can be cut by dividing the total length by the length of the first piece. The function then checks if the number of pieces is divisible by the length of the second piece, and if so, it prints the number of pieces that can be cut and returns.

If the number of pieces is not divisible by the length of the second piece, the function calculates the number of pieces that can be cut by dividing the total length by the length of the third piece. The function then checks if the number of pieces is divisible by the length of the first piece, and if so, it prints the number of pieces that can be cut and returns.

If the number of pieces is not divisible by the length of the first piece, the function calculates the number of pieces that can be cut by dividing the total length by the length of the second piece. The function then checks if the number of pieces is divisible by the length of the third piece, and if so, it prints the number of pieces that can be cut and returns.

If the number of pieces is not divisible by the length of the second piece, the function calculates the number of pieces that can be cut by dividing the total length by the length of the third piece. The function then checks if the number of pieces is divisible by the length of the first piece, and if so, it prints the number of pieces that can be cut and returns.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function prints the number of pieces that can be cut and returns.

Here is the equivalent Java code for the above Python code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class RibbonCutting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int[] lengths = Arrays.stream(scanner.nextLine().split(" ")).mapToInt(Integer::parseInt).toArray();
        int totalLength = lengths[0];
        lengths = Arrays.stream(lengths).sorted().toArray();
        if (totalLength % lengths[0] == 0) {
            System.out.println(totalLength / lengths[0]);
            return;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        if (lengths[0] == lengths[1]) {
            int k = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i <= totalLength / lengths[2]; i++) {
                int check = totalLength - i * lengths[2];
                if (check >= 0 && check % lengths[0] == 0) {
                    k = check / lengths[0];
                    ans = Math.max(ans, k + i);
                }
            }
        } else {
            int k = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i <= totalLength / lengths[2]; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j <= totalLength / lengths[1]; j++) {
                    int check = totalLength - i * lengths[2] - j * lengths[1];
                    if (check >= 0 && check % lengths[0] == 0) {
                        k = check / lengths[0];
                        ans = Math.max(ans, k + i + j);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```
Note that the Java code uses the `Arrays.stream()` method to convert the input string into an array of integers, and the `Math.max()` method to calculate the maximum value of two integers. The `Math.max()` method is used instead of the `max()` method in the Python code because the `max()` method in Java is used to find the maximum value of an array, not two integers.
