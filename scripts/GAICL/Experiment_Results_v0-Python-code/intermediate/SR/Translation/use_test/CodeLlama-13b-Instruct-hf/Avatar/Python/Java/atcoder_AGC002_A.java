The provided Python code is a bit complex and uses several libraries and functions that are not commonly used in Java. However, I can provide a basic outline of how the code could be translated to Java.

First, we need to import the necessary libraries and classes. In this case, we need to import the `java.util.Queue` class, which is used to create a queue data structure. We also need to import the `java.lang.Thread` class, which is used to create a new thread.
```java
import java.util.Queue;
import java.lang.Thread;
```
Next, we need to define the `my_decorator` function, which is used to decorate the `Func_S_0` function. In Java, we can use the `@` symbol to decorate a function.
```java
@my_decorator
public static void Func_S_0() {
    // code for the decorated function
}
```
The `my_decorator` function takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is the decorated version of the original function. In this case, the decorated function is the `Func_S_0` function.

Next, we need to define the `I` function, which is used to read an integer value from the standard input. In Java, we can use the `Scanner` class to read input from the standard input.
```java
public static int I() {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    return scanner.nextInt();
}
```
The `LI` function is used to read a list of integers from the standard input. We can use the `Scanner` class to read input from the standard input and the `Arrays.asList` method to convert the input to a list of integers.
```java
public static List<Integer> LI() {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    String input = scanner.nextLine();
    String[] tokens = input.split(" ");
    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
    for (String token : tokens) {
        list.add(Integer.parseInt(token));
    }
    return list;
}
```
The `LS` function is used to read a list of strings from the standard input. We can use the `Scanner` class to read input from the standard input and the `Arrays.asList` method to convert the input to a list of strings.
```java
public static List<String> LS() {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    String input = scanner.nextLine();
    String[] tokens = input.split(" ");
    List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
    for (String token : tokens) {
        list.add(token);
    }
    return list;
}
```
The `LI_thread` function is used to create a new thread that reads a list of integers from the standard input and puts it in a queue. We can use the `Thread` class to create a new thread and the `Queue` class to create a queue data structure.
```java
public static void LI_thread(Queue<List<Integer>> queue) {
    List<Integer> list = LI();
    queue.put(list);
}
```
The `newthread_LI0_1` function is used to create a new thread that reads a list of integers from the standard input and puts it in a queue. We can use the `Thread` class to create a new thread and the `Queue` class to create a queue data structure.
```java
public static void newthread_LI0_1(Queue<List<Integer>> queue) {
    List<Integer> list = LI();
    queue.put(list);
}
```
The `newresult_LI0_1` function is used to get the result of the `newthread_LI0_1` function from the queue. We can use the `Queue` class to get the result from the queue.
```java
public static List<Integer> newresult_LI0_1(Queue<List<Integer>> queue) {
    return queue.get();
}
```
The `ConditionChecker129` and `ConditionChecker229` variables are used to check the conditions for the `if` statement. We can use the `&&` operator to check if both conditions are true.
```java
public static boolean ConditionChecker129 = 460;
public static boolean ConditionChecker229 = 805;
```
The `if` statement is used to check the conditions and print the appropriate message. We can use the `System.out.println` method to print the message.
```java
if (ConditionChecker129 && ConditionChecker229) {
    if (a > 0) {
        System.out.println("Positive");
    } else if (a <= 0 && b >= 0) {
        System.out.println("Zero");
    } else if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) {
        System.out.println("Negative");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Positive");
    }
}
```
Overall, the provided Python code is quite complex and uses several libraries and functions that are not commonly used in Java. However, I hope this basic outline helps you understand how the code could be translated to Java.
