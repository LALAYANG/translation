The provided Python code is a program that takes a 3x3 grid of characters as input and checks if it forms a valid tic-tac-toe board. The program uses a decorator function `my_decorator` to wrap the `process_board_input` function, which is responsible for reading the input and storing it in a list. The program then uses a nested loop to iterate over the list and check if the board is valid.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TicTacToe {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String[][] board = new String[3][3];
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                board[i][j] = scanner.next();
            }
        }
        int blackCellCount = 0;
        int whiteCellCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (board[i][j].equals("#")) {
                    blackCellCount++;
                } else {
                    whiteCellCount++;
                }
            }
        }
        if (blackCellCount == 0 || blackCellCount == 3 || whiteCellCount == 0 || whiteCellCount == 3 || whiteCellCount == 4) {
            System.out.println("YES");
        } else {
            System.out.println("NO");
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses a 2D array to store the input grid, and then iterates over the array to count the number of black and white cells. If the number of black cells is 0, 3, or 4, or the number of white cells is 0, 3, or 4, the program prints "YES" to indicate that the board is valid. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Note that the Python code uses a decorator function to wrap the `process_board_input` function, which is not necessary in Java. In Java, you can simply define the `process_board_input` function as a separate method and call it from the `main` method.
