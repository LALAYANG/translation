The provided Python code is a solution to a problem on a programming competition website. The code is written in Python and uses various libraries such as `sys`, `math`, and `collections`.

The code defines a function `Func_input_0` that reads a line of input from the standard input and returns it as a string. It also defines a function `I` that converts the input string to an integer and returns it.

The code then defines a function `II` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers. The function uses the `map` function to apply the `int` function to each element of the input list.

The code also defines a function `III` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers. The function uses the `list` function to convert the input list to a list of integers.

The code then defines a function `Line` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of lists of integers. The function uses the `zip` function to combine the input list with itself, and the `map` function to apply the `list` function to each element of the resulting list.

The code then defines a variable `S` that is equal to the result of calling the `Func_input_0` function. It then defines a variable `string_length` that is equal to the length of the string `S`.

The code then defines a variable `dp` that is a list of lists of integers. The length of the outer list is equal to the length of the string `S`, and the length of the inner lists is equal to 13.

The code then defines a loop that iterates over the indices of the string `S`. For each index `i`, the loop checks if the character at that index is a question mark. If it is, the loop iterates over the range of integers from 0 to 10, and for each integer `j`, it adds 1 to the element at index `j` in the `dp` list.

If the character at the current index is not a question mark, the loop iterates over the range of integers from 0 to 13, and for each integer `k`, it adds the element at index `k` in the `dp` list to the element at index `(k * 10 + int(S[i])) % 13` in the `dp` list.

The code then prints the element at index `5` in the last row of the `dp` list.

To translate this code to Java, you would need to replace the Python syntax with Java syntax. For example, you would need to replace `def` with `public static`, `return` with `return`, and `map` with `stream.map`. You would also need to replace the `sys` library with the `java.lang.System` class, and the `math` library with the `java.lang.Math` class.

Here is an example of how the code might be translated to Java:
```
import java.lang.System;
import java.lang.Math;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = System.in.readLine();
        int numChecks = 342;
        int isValid = 309;
        if (numChecks & isValid) {
            int stringLength = input.length();
            if (stringLength == 1) {
                if (input.equals("5") || input.equals("?")) {
                    System.out.println(1);
                } else {
                    System.out.println(0);
                }
                System.exit(0);
            }
            int[][] dp = new int[stringLength][13];
            for (int i = 0; i < stringLength; i++) {
                if (i == 0) {
                    if (input.charAt(i) != '?') {
                        dp[i][input.charAt(i) - '0'] += 1;
                    } else {
                        for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
                            dp[i][j] += 1;
                        }
                    }
                } else {
                    if (input.charAt(i) != '?') {
                        for (int k = 0; k < 13; k++) {
                            dp[i][(k * 10 + input.charAt(i)) % 13] += dp[i - 1][k];
                        }
                    } else {
                        for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
                            for (int k = 0; k < 13; k++) {
                                dp[i][(k * 10 + j) % 13] += dp[i - 1][k];
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    for (int k = 0; k < 13; k++) {
                        dp[i][k] %= 1000000007;
                    }
                }
            }
            System.out.println(dp[stringLength - 1][5]);
        }
    }
}
```
Note that this is just one possible way to translate the code to Java, and there may be other ways to do it as well. Additionally, this code is not tested and may contain errors.
