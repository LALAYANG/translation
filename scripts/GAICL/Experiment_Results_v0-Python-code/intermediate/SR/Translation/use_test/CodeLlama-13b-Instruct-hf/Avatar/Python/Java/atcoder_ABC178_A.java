The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several libraries and functions that are not commonly used in Java. However, I can provide a basic outline of how the code could be translated to Java.

First, we need to import the necessary libraries and classes. In this case, we need to import the `java.util.concurrent` package for the `Thread` and `Queue` classes, as well as the `java.util.Random` class for the `shuffle` function.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.Thread;
import java.util.concurrent.Queue;
import java.util.Random;
```
Next, we need to define the `sum_inputs` function, which takes two arguments, `test_case` and `increment`, and returns the sum of these two values.
```java
public static int sum_inputs(int test_case, int increment) {
    return test_case + increment;
}
```
We also need to define the `my_decorator` function, which takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is the result of applying the decorator to the original function. In this case, the decorator simply returns the original function.
```java
public static Function my_decorator(Function func) {
    return func;
}
```
We can then define the `Func_solve_0` function, which takes a single argument, `test_case`, and prints the result of the `sum_inputs` function to the console.
```java
public static void Func_solve_0(int test_case) {
    int a = Integer.parseInt(stdin.readLine().strip());
    int result = sum_inputs(test_case, 1);
    System.out.println(result);
}
```
Finally, we can define the `main` function, which takes no arguments and calls the `Func_solve_0` function with the input `test_case` and `increment` values.
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int test_case = 1;
    int increment = 1;
    Func_solve_0(test_case, increment);
}
```
Note that this is just a basic outline of how the code could be translated to Java, and there may be additional steps or modifications required to make it fully functional.
