The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves calculating the product of two numbers and then printing the result. The code uses a decorator function to wrap the `calculate_product` function and a `worker_function` to perform the calculation in a separate thread.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class CalculateProduct {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int variable_1_10 = 10;
        int variable_3_10 = 26;
        int result = calculateProduct(variable_1_10, variable_3_10);
        System.out.println(result);
    }

    private static int calculateProduct(int variable_1_10, int variable_3_10) {
        return variable_1_10 * variable_3_10;
    }
}
```
In this code, we define a `CalculateProduct` class with a `main` method that takes two integer arguments `variable_1_10` and `variable_3_10`. The `main` method then calls the `calculateProduct` method with the two arguments and prints the result.

The `calculateProduct` method is a simple function that takes two integer arguments and returns their product.

Note that this code is not thread-safe, as it does not use any synchronization mechanisms to ensure that the `calculateProduct` method is executed correctly. If you need to use threads in your Java code, you should use synchronization mechanisms such as locks or semaphores to ensure that the code is executed correctly.
