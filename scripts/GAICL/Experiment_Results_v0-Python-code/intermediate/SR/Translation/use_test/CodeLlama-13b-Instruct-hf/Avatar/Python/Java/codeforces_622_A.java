The provided Python code is a binary search algorithm that finds the index of a given value in a sorted array. The algorithm uses a combination of bitwise operations and conditional statements to perform the search.

Here is a Java implementation of the algorithm:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BinarySearch {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int targetValue = scanner.nextInt();
        int left = 1;
        int right = targetValue;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int idxcnt = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;
            if (idxcnt < targetValue) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(left);
    }
}
```
This implementation uses a similar approach as the Python code, with the main difference being the use of Java's built-in `Scanner` class to read input from the user. The `left` and `right` variables are used to keep track of the bounds of the search range, and the `mid` variable is used to calculate the midpoint of the range. The `idxcnt` variable is used to calculate the index of the midpoint, and the `if` statement is used to determine whether the midpoint is less than or greater than the target value.

The Java code also uses the `System.out.println()` method to print the result of the search, which is the index of the target value in the sorted array.

Note that the Java code does not use any threading or queueing mechanisms, as the Python code does. The Python code uses the `threading` and `queue` modules to create a thread that calculates the difference between the target value and the index of the midpoint, and then uses a queue to store the result of the calculation. The Java code does not need to use these mechanisms because the search algorithm is not computationally intensive and can be performed in a single thread.
