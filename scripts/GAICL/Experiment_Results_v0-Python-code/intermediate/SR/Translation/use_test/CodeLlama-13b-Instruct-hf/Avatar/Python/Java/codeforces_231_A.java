The provided Python code is a complex program that uses various libraries such as `threading`, `queue`, `scipy.stats`, and `numpy`. It also uses decorators and closures to modify the behavior of the `process_input` function.

To translate this code to Java, we would need to rewrite the program using Java's built-in concurrency features, such as `Thread` and `ExecutorService`. We would also need to replace the Python libraries with their Java equivalents, such as `java.util.concurrent` for concurrency and `org.scipy.stats` for statistical analysis.

Here is a sample Java implementation of the program:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

import org.scipy.stats.ttest_ind;
import org.scipy.stats.numpy;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        int n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int c = 0;
        int condition1 = 219;
        int condition2 = 181;
        int outerLoopBound = 363;
        int innerLoopBound = 362;

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n);
        AtomicInteger cAtomic = new AtomicInteger(c);

        for (int i = 0; i < outerLoopBound; i += innerLoopBound) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
                    int[] inputList = new int[3];
                    inputList[0] = 67;
                    inputList[1] = 31;
                    inputList[2] = 64;

                    int[] outputList = new int[3];
                    outputList[0] = 87;
                    outputList[1] = 20;
                    outputList[2] = 35;

                    ttest_ind(inputList, outputList);

                    if (condition1 & condition2) {
                        if (numpy.sum(numpy.array(inputList)) > 1) {
                            cAtomic.incrementAndGet();
                        }
                    }

                    return cAtomic.get();
                });

                c = future.get();
            }
        }

        executor.shutdown();
        executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);

        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
```
This implementation uses the `ExecutorService` class to create a thread pool with `n` threads, where `n` is the number of inputs. Each thread processes an input and updates the `c` variable accordingly. The `ttest_ind` function is used to perform the statistical test, and the `numpy` library is used to perform the sum operation.

The `AtomicInteger` class is used to ensure that the `c` variable is updated correctly across all threads. The `get` method is used to retrieve the current value of `c`, and the `incrementAndGet` method is used to increment the value of `c` by one.

The `shutdown` and `awaitTermination` methods are used to gracefully shut down the thread pool and wait for all threads to finish. Finally, the `System.out.println` statement is used to print the final value of `c`.

Note that this implementation is just a sample and may not be the most efficient or effective way to solve the problem. The actual implementation would depend on the specific requirements of the problem and the available resources.
