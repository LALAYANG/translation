The provided Python code is a complex program that uses decorators, threads, and queues to perform a series of calculations. The program takes in three lists of numbers as input, and then performs a series of operations on them.

To translate this program to Java, we need to first understand the logic of the program and then implement it in Java. Here is a high-level overview of the program:

1. The program takes in three lists of numbers as input.
2. It then performs a series of calculations on these lists using decorators, threads, and queues.
3. The calculations involve adding the elements of the lists together, and then performing a statistical test on the results.
4. The program then prints the results of the calculations to the console.

To implement this program in Java, we can use the following steps:

1. Create a class to represent the input data. This class should have three fields to store the three lists of numbers.
2. Create a class to represent the results of the calculations. This class should have three fields to store the results of the calculations.
3. Create a method to perform the calculations. This method should take in the input data as a parameter, and then perform the calculations using the decorators, threads, and queues.
4. Create a method to print the results of the calculations to the console.
5. Create a main method to test the program. This method should create an instance of the input data class, perform the calculations using the method created in step 3, and then print the results to the console.

Here is an example of how the program could be implemented in Java:
```
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;

public class Calculations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of the input data class
        InputData inputData = new InputData(List.of(1, 4, 3, 3, 5, 7), List.of(3, 7, 5, 4, 3), List.of(4, 3, 7, 5));

        // Perform the calculations
        CalculationResults results = performCalculations(inputData);

        // Print the results to the console
        System.out.println("Results:");
        System.out.println("x: " + results.getX());
        System.out.println("y: " + results.getY());
        System.out.println("z: " + results.getZ());
    }

    private static CalculationResults performCalculations(InputData inputData) {
        // Create a new instance of the calculation results class
        CalculationResults results = new CalculationResults();

        // Create a new instance of the executor service
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Create a new instance of the callable class
        Callable<Integer> callable = new Callable<Integer>() {
            @Override

                for (int i = 0; i < inputData.getList1().size(); i++) {
                    result += inputData.getList1().get(i);
                }
                return result;
            }

        // Submit the callable to the executor service
        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(callable);

        // Get the result of the calculation
        int x = future.get();

        // Add the result to the calculation results
        results.setX(x);

        // Repeat the process for the other two lists
        for (int i = 0; i < inputData.getList2().size(); i++) {
            callable = new Callable<Integer>() {
                @Override

This program uses the `ExecutorService` class to create a thread pool and submit tasks to it. The `Callable` class is used to define the tasks that will be executed by the threads in the thread pool. The `Future` class is used to get the result of the calculation.

The `performCalculations` method takes in an instance of the `InputData` class as a parameter, and then performs the calculations using the decorators, threads, and queues. The method returns an instance of the `CalculationResults` class, which contains the results of the calculations.

The `main` method creates an instance of the `InputData` class, performs the calculations using the `performCalculations` method, and then prints the results to the console.

Note that this is just one possible way to implement the program in Java, and there may be other ways to do it as well.
