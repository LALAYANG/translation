The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several concepts that are not commonly used in Java programming. However, I can provide a high-level overview of the code and explain how it works.

The code first imports several libraries, including `datetime`, `time`, and `scipy.stats`. It then defines a decorator function called `my_decorator` that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is decorated with the `my_decorator` functionality.

The `my_decorator` function first calls the `shuffle` function from the `sklearn.utils` module to shuffle a list of three numbers. It then defines a new function called `dec_result` that takes any number of arguments and returns the result of calling the original function with those arguments. The `dec_result` function also calls the `datetime.datetime.now()` function to get the current date and time.

The code then defines a function called `recursive_game_loop` that takes three arguments: `j`, `stop`, and `step`. The `recursive_game_loop` function is decorated with the `my_decorator` function, which means that it will be called with the `my_decorator` functionality.

The `recursive_game_loop` function is a recursive function that takes a starting value `j`, a stopping value `stop`, and a step value `step`. It then checks if the step value is zero or if the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to the stopping value. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns.

Otherwise, the function checks if the starting value `j` is greater than the current value of `j`. If it is, the function appends a tuple containing the starting value `j` and the current value of `j` to a list called `games`. The function then calls itself recursively with the current value of `j` plus the step value, the stopping value, and the step value.

The code then defines a function called `Func_loop_10_12_0` that is similar to the `recursive_game_loop` function, but it has a different name and is not decorated with the `my_decorator` function.

The code then defines two variables called `newConditionChecker14_1` and `newConditionChecker24_1` that are used to check if a condition is true. If the condition is true, the code calls the `recursive_game_loop` function with the appropriate arguments.

Finally, the code prints the length of the `games` list and then iterates over the list and prints each tuple in the list.

In summary, the code defines a decorator function that shuffles a list of three numbers and then defines a recursive function that takes three arguments and checks if a condition is true. If the condition is true, the function appends a tuple to a list and then calls itself recursively with the appropriate arguments. The code then defines two variables that are used to check if a condition is true and calls the recursive function with the appropriate arguments. Finally, the code prints the length of the list and then iterates over the list and prints each tuple in the list.
