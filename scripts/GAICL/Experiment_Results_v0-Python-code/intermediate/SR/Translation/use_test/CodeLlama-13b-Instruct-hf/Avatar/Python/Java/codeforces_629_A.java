The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves calculating the happiness of a person based on the number of chocolates they have. The code uses a decorator function to calculate the factorial of the number of chocolates, and then divides the result by 2 to get the happiness.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ChocolateHappiness {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        String[] cake = new String[n];
        int happiness = 0;
        int chocCount = 0;
        int nfat = 1;
        int check_1 = 585;
        int check_2 = 215;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String cakeLine = scanner.nextLine();
            cake[i] = cakeLine;
            for (int j = 0; j < cakeLine.length(); j++) {
                if (cakeLine.charAt(j) == 'C') {
                    chocCount++;
                }
            }
            if (check_1 & check_2) {
                if (chocCount > 1) {
                    for (int i = chocCount; i > chocCount - 2; i--) {
                        nfat *= i;
                    }
                    happiness += nfat / 2;
                }
            }
            nfat = 1;
            chocCount = 0;
        }

        int newposCount = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (cake[i].charAt(j) == 'C') {
                    chocCount++;
                }
            }
            if (chocCount > 1) {
                for (int i = chocCount; i > chocCount - 2; i--) {
                    nfat *= i;
                }
                happiness += nfat / 2;
            }
            nfat = 1;
            chocCount = 0;
        }

        System.out.println(happiness);
    }
}
```
Note that the Java code uses a different approach to calculate the factorial of the number of chocolates, by using a for loop to multiply the number by each of the previous numbers. This approach is more efficient than using a decorator function, but it may not be as readable or maintainable as the Python code.
