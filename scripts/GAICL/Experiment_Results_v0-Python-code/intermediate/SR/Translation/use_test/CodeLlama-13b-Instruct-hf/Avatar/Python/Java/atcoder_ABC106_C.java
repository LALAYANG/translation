The provided Python code is using a decorator to wrap the `Func_LI_0` function, which is then used to read input from the standard input. The decorator is defined as follows:
```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def dec_result(*args, **kwargs):
        res = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return res
    return dec_result
```
This decorator takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that wraps the original function. The new function, `dec_result`, calls the original function with the same arguments and returns its result.

The `Func_LI_0` function is then defined as follows:
```python
@my_decorator
def Func_LI_0():
    return [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
```
This function is decorated with the `my_decorator` decorator, which means that it will be wrapped with the `dec_result` function. The `Func_LI_0` function is then defined as a list comprehension that reads input from the standard input and splits it into a list of integers.

The rest of the code is similar to the provided Python code, with the exception of the `my_decorator` decorator and the `Func_LI_0` function. The `LI_`, `LF`, `LS`, `I`, `F`, `S`, and `pf` functions are defined in the same way as in the provided Python code. The `main` function is also defined in the same way, with the exception of the `Func_LI_0` function, which is now wrapped with the `my_decorator` decorator.

To translate this code to Java, you can use the following code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        int k = scanner.nextInt();
        int leadingOnesCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
            if (input.charAt(i) != '1') {
                break;
            }
            leadingOnesCount++;
        }
        if (leadingOnesCount >= k) {
            System.out.println(1);
        } else {
            System.out.println(input.charAt(leadingOnesCount));
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the standard input, and then uses a `for` loop to count the number of leading ones in the input string. If the number of leading ones is greater than or equal to `k`, the code prints `1` to the console. Otherwise, it prints the character at the index `leadingOnesCount` in the input string.

Note that the `my_decorator` decorator is not needed in Java, as Java does not have a similar concept of decorators. Instead, the `Func_LI_0` function can be defined directly as a list comprehension that reads input from the standard input and splits it into a list of integers.
