The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several libraries and functions that are not commonly used in Java. However, I can provide a basic outline of how the code could be translated to Java.

First, we need to import the necessary libraries and classes. In this case, we need to import the `java.util.Queue` class for the `Queue` data structure and the `java.lang.Thread` class for the `Thread` class.
```java
import java.util.Queue;
import java.lang.Thread;
```
Next, we need to define the `divide_numbers` function, which takes two arguments, `number` and `divisor`, and returns the result of dividing `number` by `divisor`.
```java
public static int divide_numbers(int number, int divisor) {
    return number / divisor;
}
```
We also need to define the `my_decorator` function, which takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that wraps the original function. In this case, the new function is called `dec_result` and it takes the same arguments as the original function.
```java
public static Function my_decorator(Function func) {
    return new Function() {
        @Override
        public Object apply(Object... args) {
            Object res = func.apply(args);
            return res;
        }
    };
}
```
We can then use the `my_decorator` function to decorate the `divide_numbers` function and create a new function called `division_worker` that takes a `Queue` object as an argument and returns the result of dividing `number` by `divisor`.
```java
Function division_worker = my_decorator(divide_numbers);
```
We can then create a new `Thread` object and start it using the `division_worker` function.
```java
Thread worker_thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        division_worker.apply(number, divisor);
    }
});
worker_thread.start();
```
We can then use the `Queue` object to get the result of the division.
```java
Queue<Integer> result_queue = new LinkedList<>();
worker_thread.join();
int division_result = result_queue.get();
```
Finally, we can check if the result of the division is equal to 1 and print "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
```java
if (division_result == 1) {
    System.out.println("YES");
} else {
    System.out.println("NO");
}
```
Note that this is just a basic outline of how the code could be translated to Java, and there are many details that are not included in this example. Additionally, the code uses several libraries and functions that are not commonly used in Java, so it may not be directly applicable to your specific use case.
