The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves finding the minimum value of a function that satisfies a certain condition. The function is defined as `Func_sum_0(k)`, which takes an integer `k` as input and returns an integer value. The condition is that the function should be less than or equal to a given value `w`.

The Python code uses the `scipy.stats` library to perform a statistical test on the input data. It then uses a binary search algorithm to find the minimum value of `Func_sum_0(k)` that satisfies the condition.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int w = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        int k = scanner.nextInt();
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = (int) Math.pow(10, 18);
        while (hi - lo > 1) {
            int md = (lo + hi) / 2;
            int c = Func_sum_0(m + md - 1) - Func_sum_0(m - 1);
            if (c * k <= w) {
                lo = md;
            } else {
                hi = md;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(lo);
    }

    public static int Func_sum_0(int k) {
        int ret = 0;
        int newpw_1 = 10;
        int len = 1;
        while (true) {
            int cur = Math.min(newpw_1 - 1, k);
            int prev = newpw_1 / 10;
            ret += (cur - prev + 1) * len;
            if (newpw_1 - 1 >= k) {
                break;
            }
            len = len + 1;
            newpw_1 = newpw_1 * 10;
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
```
This code uses the same binary search algorithm as the Python code, but it is written in Java. It also uses the `Math.pow()` method to calculate the value of `hi` as `Math.pow(10, 18)`.

The `Func_sum_0(k)` method is defined in the same way as in the Python code, with the only difference being that it is written in Java.

The rest of the code is similar to the Python code, with the only difference being that it is written in Java.
