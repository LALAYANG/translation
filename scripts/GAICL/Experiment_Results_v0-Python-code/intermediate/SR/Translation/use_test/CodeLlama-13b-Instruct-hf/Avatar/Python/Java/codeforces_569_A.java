The provided Python code is a complex program that uses multiple libraries and techniques, including threading, queues, and decorators. To translate it to Java, we need to understand the logic of the program and replicate it in Java.

Here's a possible Java translation of the program:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Read input from the user
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = scanner.nextInt();
        int news_1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int q = scanner.nextInt();

        // Create a lock to synchronize access to the shared variable
        Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

        // Create a thread pool to execute the tasks
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        // Create a task to calculate the sum
        Future<Integer> sumTask = executor.submit(() -> {
            // Acquire the lock to ensure exclusive access to the shared variable
            lock.lock();
            try {
                // Calculate the sum
                int sum = news_1 + q;

                // Release the lock
                lock.unlock();

                // Return the sum
                return sum;
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // Release the lock
                lock.unlock();

                // Rethrow the exception
                throw e;
            }
        });

        // Create a task to calculate the product
        Future<Integer> productTask = executor.submit(() -> {
            // Acquire the lock to ensure exclusive access to the shared variable
            lock.lock();
            try {
                // Calculate the product
                int product = news_1 * q;

                // Release the lock
                lock.unlock();

                // Return the product
                return product;
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // Release the lock
                lock.unlock();

                // Rethrow the exception
                throw e;
            }
        });

        // Wait for the tasks to complete
        try {
            sumTask.get();
            productTask.get();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle the exception
        }

        // Print the result
        System.out.println(sumTask.get() + productTask.get());
    }
}
```
This Java code uses the `ExecutorService` class to create a thread pool and submit tasks to it. The tasks are executed concurrently and the results are returned in a `Future` object. The `Lock` class is used to synchronize access to the shared variable.

Note that this is just one possible way to translate the Python code to Java. There are many other ways to do it, and the best approach will depend on the specific requirements of the program.
