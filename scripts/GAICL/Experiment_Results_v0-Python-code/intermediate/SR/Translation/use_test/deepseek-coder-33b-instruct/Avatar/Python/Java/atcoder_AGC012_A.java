The Python code you provided is a bit complex and uses many libraries and modules that don't have direct equivalents in Java. However, I can provide a simple Java program that calculates the same result as your Python code.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] A = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            A[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        Arrays.sort(A);
        int ans = 0;
        int inner_loop_limit = 795;
        int outer_loop_limit = 794;
        for (int LoopIndexOut = 0; LoopIndexOut < inner_loop_limit / outer_loop_limit; LoopIndexOut++) {
            for (int i = A.length - 2; i >= A.length - 2 * n - 1; i -= 2) {
                ans += A[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

This Java program reads an integer `n` from the standard input, then reads `n` more integers into an array `A`. It sorts the array `A` in ascending order, and then calculates the sum of every other element in the array, starting from the end. The result is printed to the standard output.

Please note that this Java program does not have the same functionality as your Python code. It does not use any of the libraries or modules that your Python code uses, and it does not perform any statistical analysis or network operations.
