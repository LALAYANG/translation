The given Python code is a set of operations that involve various libraries such as dateutil, http, cryptography, time, sklearn, scipy, numpy etc. These operations are not directly translatable to Java as Java does not have equivalent libraries.

However, I can provide a Java code snippet that does the same operations as the Python code. Note that this is a simplified version and does not include all the operations in the original Python code.

```java
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int count = scanner.nextInt();
        double[] values = new double[count];
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            double value = scanner.nextDouble();
            String currency = scanner.next();
            if (currency.equals("JPY")) {
                value *= 1.0;
            } else if (currency.equals("BTC")) {
                value *= 380000.0;
            }
            values[i] = value;
        }
        double sum = Arrays.stream(values).sum();
        System.out.println(sum);

        // Simulate network latency
        Thread.sleep(40);

        // Simulate HTTP request
        URL url = new URL("http://google.com");
        HttpURLConnection http = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();
        System.out.println(http.getResponseCode());
        http.disconnect();
    }
}
```

This Java code does the following:

1. Reads the number of values to be processed.
2. Reads the values and their corresponding currencies.
3. Converts the values to a common currency (in this case, JPY).
4. Sums up the values.
5. Simulates network latency by sleeping for 40 milliseconds.
6. Simulates an HTTP request to "http://google.com".
7. Prints the sum of the values.

Please note that this Java code does not include the t-test operation, which is not directly translatable to Java. Also, the cryptography and sklearn operations are not included in this code.
