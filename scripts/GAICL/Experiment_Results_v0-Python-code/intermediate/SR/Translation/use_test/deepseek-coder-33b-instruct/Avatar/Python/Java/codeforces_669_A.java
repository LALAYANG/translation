Here is the Java equivalent of the Python code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int numInput = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println((calculateTtest(numInput, 2) + 1) / 3);
    }

    public static int calculateTtest(int a, int b) {
        return multiply3647(a, b);
    }

    public static int[] shuffle(int[] array) {
        Arrays.sort(array);
        return array;
    }

    public static int multiply3647(int arg0, int arg1) {
        return arg0 * arg1;
    }
}
```

Please note that the `ttest_ind` function from `scipy.stats` and `shuffle` function from `sklearn.utils` are not available in Java. They are used for statistical analysis and data shuffling respectively, which are not directly available in Java.

Also, the `my_decorator` function is not used in the Python code, so it is not included in the Java code.

The `calculate_ttest` function in the Python code is equivalent to the `calculateTtest` function in the Java code. The `multiply_3647` function in the Python code is equivalent to the `multiply3647` function in the Java code.

The `shuffle` function in the Python code is equivalent to the `shuffle` function in the Java code.

The `calculateTtest` function is decorated with `my_decorator` in the Python code, but it is not used in the Java code.

The `calculateTtest` function is called with `num_input` and `2` as arguments in the Python code. In the Java code, it is called with `numInput` and `2` as arguments.

The `calculateTtest` function returns the result of `multiply3647` function, which is equivalent to the `multiply_3647` function in the Python code.
