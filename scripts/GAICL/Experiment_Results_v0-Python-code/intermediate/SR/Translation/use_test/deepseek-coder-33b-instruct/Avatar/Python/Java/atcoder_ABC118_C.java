The given Python code is a set of operations that are not directly translatable to Java. It includes operations such as HTTP requests, base64 encoding, cryptography, statistical analysis, date and time operations, and more.

Java does not have direct equivalents for all these operations. For example, Java does not have a built-in HTTP client library, and it does not have a built-in base64 encoding library. It also does not have a built-in cryptography library.

However, Java does have libraries that can be used to perform these operations. For example, Java has the `java.net.HttpURLConnection` class for making HTTP requests, and the `java.util.Base64` class for base64 encoding.

Here is a simple example of how to make an HTTP request in Java:

```java
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        URL url = new URL("http://google.com");
        HttpURLConnection http = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();
        int statusCode = http.getResponseCode();
        System.out.println("HTTP status code: " + statusCode);
    }
}
```

And here is a simple example of how to encode a string in base64 in Java:

```java
import java.util.Base64;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String originalInput = "Hello World!";
        String encodedString = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(originalInput.getBytes());
        System.out.println("Encoded string: " + encodedString);
    }
}
```

Please note that these are very basic examples and do not include error handling or other important features that a production-level application would need. Also, Java does not have a built-in cryptography library, so you would need to use a third-party library such as Bouncy Castle.

For the rest of the operations, you would need to use appropriate Java libraries or APIs. For example, for date and time operations, you would use the `java.time` package. For statistical analysis, you would use a library such as Apache Commons Math.

In conclusion, the given Python code cannot be directly translated to Java because Java does not have direct equivalents for all the operations in the code. Instead, you would need to use appropriate Java libraries or APIs for each operation.
