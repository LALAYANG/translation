Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    static int k;
    static int[] count = new int[26];
    static int res = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        k = scanner.nextInt();
        String s = scanner.next();

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            count[c - 'A']++;
        }

        Arrays.sort(count);

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (count[i] >= k) {
                res += k * k;
                System.out.println(res);
                System.exit(0);
            }

            res += count[i] * count[i];
            k -= count[i];
        }

        System.out.println(res);
    }
}
```

Please note that the Python code uses the `scipy.stats.ttest_ind` function, which is not available in Java. The equivalent functionality in Java would be to implement the t-test manually or use a library that provides this functionality.

Also, the Python code uses threads and queues, which are not necessary in this case. The Java code simply calculates the result sequentially.

The Java code also uses the `System.exit(0)` function to exit the program, which is not necessary in this case. The equivalent functionality in Java would be to use a `return` statement.

The Java code also uses the `ord` function to get the ASCII value of a character, which is not necessary in this case. The equivalent functionality in Java would be to use the `charAt` method of the `String` class.

The Java code also uses the `map` function to split the input, which is not necessary in this case. The equivalent functionality in Java would be to use the `split` method of the `String` class.
