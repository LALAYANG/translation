Please note that the Python code you provided uses some libraries that do not have direct equivalents in Java, such as `scipy.stats` and `threading`. In Java, you would typically use `java.util.concurrent` for threading and `javax.script` for scripting languages like Python. However, these libraries are not used in the provided Python code, so they were not included in the Java translation.
