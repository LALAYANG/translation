This Java code is a direct translation of the Python code you provided. It includes the same functionality, but with different syntax and structure. The Python code uses a lot of libraries and decorators, which are not available in Java. Therefore, the Java code does not include these features.

Please note that the Java code does not include the t-test and shuffle functionality, as these are not necessary for the problem at hand. The t-test is used for statistical analysis, and the shuffle function is used for randomizing the order of elements in a list. These are not relevant for the problem of counting the number of 0s and 1s in an input string.

The Java code also does not include the decorator functionality, as Java does not support decorators in the same way that Python does. However, the Java code does include a main method that you can use to run the program.

The Java code includes a main method that reads an input string from the user, counts the number of 0s and 1s at even and odd indices, and then prints the minimum of the two sums.
