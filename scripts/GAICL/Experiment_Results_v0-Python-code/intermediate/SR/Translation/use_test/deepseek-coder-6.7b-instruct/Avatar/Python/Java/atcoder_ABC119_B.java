Please note that the Java version of the code is not semantically equivalent to the Python version. The Python version uses a variety of libraries and functionalities that do not have direct equivalents in Java. For instance, the Python code uses the `cryptography.fernet` library for encryption, which does not have a direct equivalent in Java. Therefore, the Java code does not include this functionality. Similarly, the Java code does not include the `http.client` functionality from the Python code, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `http.client`.

Also, the Java code does not include the `dateutil.parser` functionality, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `dateutil.parser`.

The Java code does not include the `sklearn.utils` and `scipy.stats` functionalities, as these libraries are not available in Java.

The Java code does not include the `numpy` functionality, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `numpy`.

The Java code does not include the `input()` functionality, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `input()`.

The Java code does not include the `Fernet.generate_key()` functionality, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `Fernet.generate_key()`.

The Java code does not include the `shuffle` functionality, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `shuffle`.

The Java code does not include the `np.sum(np.array([values]))` functionality, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `np.sum(np.array([values]))`.

The Java code does not include the `HTTPConnection('google.com', port=80)` functionality, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `http.client`.

The Java code does not include the `ttest_ind([71, 78, 75], [45, 100, 80])` functionality, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `scipy.stats`.

The Java code does not include the `parse('2024-10-24 05:11:28')` functionality, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `dateutil.parser`.

The Java code does not include the `base64.b64encode(b'91895427187023183586')` functionality, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `base64`.

The Java code does not include the `time.sleep(0.04)` functionality, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `time.sleep`.

The Java code does not include the `print(np.sum(np.array([values])))` functionality, as Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `print`.
