This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads a list of integers, calculates the XOR of all the numbers, and then calculates the XOR of each number in the list with the XOR of all the numbers. The results are printed to the console.

Please note that Java does not have a built-in library for cryptography like Python's cryptography. If you need to use cryptography in Java, you would need to use a third-party library or API.

Also, Java does not have a built-in date parsing library like Python's dateutil. If you need to parse dates in Java, you would need to use a third-party library or API.

Finally, Java does not have a built-in HTTP library like Python's http.client. If you need to make HTTP requests in Java, you would need to use a third-party library or API.
