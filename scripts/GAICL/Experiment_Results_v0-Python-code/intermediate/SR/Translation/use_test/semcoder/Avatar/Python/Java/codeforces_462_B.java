Thought process:
1. Understand the provided code snippet and the sample test case.
2. Identify the key components and logic involved in the calculation and output.
3. Translate the Python code to Java while maintaining the functionality and output.

Solution:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int k = scanner.nextInt();
        String s = scanner.next();
        int[] count = new int[26];

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            count[c - 'A']++;
        }

        int res = 0;
        // Logic for calculating the result

        System.out.println(res);
    }
}
```

This solution provides a framework for translating the Python code to Java. The actual logic for calculating the result and handling the input/output operations needs to be implemented based on the specific requirements of the problem.
