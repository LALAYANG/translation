The provided code snippet is a Python program that performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm on a graph and outputs the maximum number of colors used and the color assignments for each edge. The code is structured to run in a multi-threaded environment using Python's `threading` module.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the BFS algorithm and the conditions specified in the code snippet. The BFS algorithm explores nodes in a graph by traversing breadth-wise from a starting node. The colors assigned to edges are determined by the BFS traversal process.

The conditions in the code snippet are used to control the flow of the BFS algorithm and determine the color assignments for edges. The conditions are based on bitwise operations and logical conditions.

The provided solution code is a Python implementation of the BFS algorithm with multi-threading support. It reads input data, performs the BFS traversal, and outputs the maximum number of colors used and the color assignments for each edge.
