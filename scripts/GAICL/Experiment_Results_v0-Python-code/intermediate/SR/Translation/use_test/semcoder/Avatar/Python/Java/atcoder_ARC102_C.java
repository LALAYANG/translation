To solve this problem, we need to translate the given Python code into Java code. Here is the planned approach:
1. Translate the input-output code snippet into Java code.
2. Implement the necessary functions and classes to match the functionality of the Python code.
3. Ensure that the Java code produces the same output as the Python code for the given test case.

```java
// Translate the input-output code snippet into Java code

// Implement the necessary functions and classes to match the functionality of the Python code

// Ensure that the Java code produces the same output as the Python code for the given test case

```

This problem requires a deep understanding of Python syntax, libraries, and functionalities to translate and execute the given code snippet accurately.
