To solve this problem, we need to understand the given code snippet and the specific function calls made in the test case. The code snippet is a collection of functions that perform mathematical operations, date and time operations, HTTP requests, encryption, and statistical calculations.

The test case input provides two permutations, and we need to find the absolute difference between their indices in the list of all permutations.

Here is a step-by-step solution outline:
1. Parse the input integer `n`.
2. Generate all permutations of numbers from 1 to `n-1`.
3. Read two permutations `permutation_p` and `permutation_q`.
4. Find the indices of `permutation_p` and `permutation_q` in the list of permutations.
5. Calculate the absolute difference between their indices.
6. Print the absolute difference.

Below is the Python solution implementing the outlined steps:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def calculate_permutation_index(permutation):
    all_permutations = list(permutations(range(1, len(permutation))))
    return all_permutations.index(permutation)

n = int(input())
all_permutations = list(permutations(range(1, n)))

permutation_p = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
permutation_q = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

permutation_index_p = calculate_permutation_index(permutation_p)
permutation_index_q = calculate_permutation_index(permutation_q)

print(abs(permutation_index_p - permutation_index_q))
```

This solution efficiently calculates the absolute difference between the indices of two given permutations within all permutations of numbers from 1 to `n-1`.
