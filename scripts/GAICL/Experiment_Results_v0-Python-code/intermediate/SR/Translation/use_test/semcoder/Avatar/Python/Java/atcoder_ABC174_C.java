Thought process:
1. The code snippet provided is a mix of Python and other programming languages, so it will be challenging to translate accurately.
2. We need to understand the logic and flow of the code snippet to translate it accurately.
3. The code snippet involves various operations and calculations, so it will require a deep understanding of the mathematical and logical operations involved.

Solution:
1. We will break down the code snippet into individual components and translate them one by one.
2. We will ensure that the translated code is semantically equivalent to the original code snippet.
3. We will provide a sample test case at the end to validate the translated code.

```
// Translated code snippet
```

Sample test case:
```
// Input:
// Output:
