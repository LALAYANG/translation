To solve this problem, we need to implement the logic described in the Python code snippet. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Import the necessary library `scipy.stats`.
2. Perform a two-sample independent t-test using `ttest_ind` function.
3. Read two integers `value_1` and `z` from input.
4. Calculate the result as `(value_1 // z + 1) * z`.
5. Print the result.

Here is the Java solution:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int value_1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int z = scanner.nextInt();
        int result = (value_1 / z + 1) * z;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

You can run this Java program with the provided test input to obtain the expected output.
