The Python code you provided is quite complex and contains many nested loops, so I've tried to simplify it as much as possible while still maintaining its functionality. The resulting Java code is much more straightforward and easier to read.

The main differences between the Python and Java code are:

* In Python, the `input()` function is used to read input from the user, while in Java, the `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* In Python, the `range()` function is used to create a sequence of numbers, while in Java, the `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
* In Python, the `if` statement is used to check conditions, while in Java, the `if` statement is used to check conditions and the `else` statement is used to execute code if the condition is not met.
* In Python, the `def` keyword is used to define a function, while in Java, the `public` keyword is used to define a method.
* In Python, the `return` statement is used to return a value from a function, while in Java, the `return` statement is used to return a value from a method.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
