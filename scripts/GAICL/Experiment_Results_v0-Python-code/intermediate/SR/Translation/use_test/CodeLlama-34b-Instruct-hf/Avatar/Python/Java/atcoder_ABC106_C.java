The Python code you provided is a bit complex, but I'll do my best to translate it to Java. Here's the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.concurrent.Thread;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Queue<String> queue = new Queue<>();

        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            String input = scanner.nextLine();
            queue.add(input);
        });

        thread.start();
        thread.join();

        String s = queue.poll();
        int k = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

        int leadingOnesCount = 0;
        int innerLoopBound = 68;
        int outerLoopBound = 67;

        for (int i = 0; i < innerLoopBound / outerLoopBound; i++) {
            for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
                if (c != '1') {
                    break;
                }
                leadingOnesCount++;
            }
        }

        if (leadingOnesCount >= k) {
            System.out.println(1);
        } else {
            System.out.println(s.charAt(leadingOnesCount));
        }
    }
}
```
Note that I've used a `Scanner` to read input from the user, and a `Queue` to store the input string. The `Thread` class is used to create a new thread that reads the input string and adds it to the queue. The main thread then retrieves the input string from the queue and processes it.

The rest of the code is similar to the Python code you provided, with a few minor changes to account for the differences between Python and Java. For example, in Java, we use `charAt()` to access a character in a string by its index, rather than using the `[]` operator as we do in Python.
