```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DecoratorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int h = scanner.nextInt();
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int sho = h / a;
        int am = h % a;
        if (am != 0) {
            int variable_3_12 = 1;
            sho = func0(variable_3_12, sho);
        }
        System.out.println(sho);
    }

    public static int func0(int variable_3_12, int sho) {
        return sho + variable_3_12;
    }
}
```
The above code is a Java implementation of the Python code you provided. It uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user and the `System.out.println()` method to print output to the console. The `func0()` method is a decorated method that takes two arguments, `variable_3_12` and `sho`, and returns the sum of the two arguments. The `main()` method is the entry point of the program, it reads the input from the user, calculates the value of `sho` and `am`, and then calls the `func0()` method if `am` is not equal to 0.

The Python code you provided is a bit complex, it uses decorators, threading, and queues, which are not needed in this Java implementation. The Java code is much simpler and easier to understand.
