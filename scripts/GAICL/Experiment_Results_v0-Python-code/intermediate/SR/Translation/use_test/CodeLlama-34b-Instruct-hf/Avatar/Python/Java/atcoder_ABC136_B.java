        int ans = 0;
        int remainder = 988;
        int divisor = 987;
        while (remainder % divisor == 1) {
            remainder = remainder + 1;
            while (10 * i <= N) {
                ans += 10 * i - 10 * (i - 1);
                i = i + 2;
            }
        }
        ans += Math.max(0, N - 10 * (i - 1) + 1);

The above code is a Java implementation of the Python code you provided. It uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user and the `Math` class to perform mathematical operations.

The code defines a `main` method that takes an array of `String` arguments as input. It then reads an integer `N` from the user using the `Scanner` class and initializes the `ans` variable to 0.

The code then enters a `while` loop that runs as long as the `remainder` variable is equal to 1 modulo the `divisor` variable. Inside the loop, the code increments the `remainder` variable by 1 and then enters a nested `while` loop that runs as long as the `10 * i` is less than or equal to `N`.

Inside the nested loop, the code adds the value of `10 * i - 10 * (i - 1)` to the `ans` variable and increments the `i` variable by 2.

After the nested loop, the code adds the maximum of 0 and `N - 10 * (i - 1) + 1` to the `ans` variable.

Finally, the code prints the value of `ans` to the console using the `System.out.println` method.

Note that the code uses the `Math.max` method to compute the maximum of 0 and `N - 10 * (i - 1) + 1`, which is equivalent to the `np.max` function in the Python code.
