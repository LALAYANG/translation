The Python code you provided is a bit hard to read due to the use of one-letter variable names and the lack of comments. However, I'll do my best to provide a Java implementation of the code based on my understanding of what it does.

The code appears to be implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse a graph represented as an adjacency list. The BFS algorithm starts at a given vertex (represented by the variable `v`) and explores all the vertices in the graph by visiting each vertex at most once. The algorithm also keeps track of the color of each vertex, which is used to determine the color of the edge between two vertices.

Here's a Java implementation of the BFS algorithm:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue;

public class BFS {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = 5; // number of vertices in the graph
        int[][] G = new int[N][N]; // adjacency list representation of the graph
        int[] node2color = new int[N]; // color of each vertex
        int[][] E = new int[N][N]; // edge between two vertices

        // initialize the graph
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                G[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }

        // initialize the colors of the vertices
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            node2color[i] = -1;
        }

        // perform the BFS
        int v = 0; // starting vertex
        int K = -1; // maximum color of the graph
        Queue<Integer> queue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
        queue.add(v);
        node2color[v] = 0;
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int currentNode = queue.poll();
            int color = 0;
            for (int nex : G[currentNode]) {
                if (node2color[nex] == -1) {
                    node2color[nex] = color;
                    E[currentNode][nex] = color;
                    queue.add(nex);
                    color++;
                }
            }
            K = Math.max(K, color);
        }

        // print the results
        System.out.println("K = " + K);
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                System.out.print(E[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```
Note that this implementation uses a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` to store the vertices to be visited, which allows for concurrent access to the queue from multiple threads. This is necessary because the BFS algorithm can be parallelized by processing the vertices in parallel.

Also, note that the `node2color` array is used to keep track of the color of each vertex, and the `E` array is used to keep track of the edge between two vertices. The `K` variable is used to keep track of the maximum color of the graph.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
