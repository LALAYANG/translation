The above code is a Java implementation of the Python code you provided. It uses the `System.console().readLine()` method to read input from the console, and the `Integer.parseInt()` method to parse the input as an integer. The `if` statement is used to check if the input is equal to 0, and the `System.out.println()` method is used to print the output.

The `ThreadLocalRandom` class is used to generate random numbers, but it is not used in the code you provided. If you need to generate random numbers in your code, you can use the `ThreadLocalRandom` class.

The `while` loop is used to iterate over the test cases, and the `testCase` variable is used to keep track of the current test case. The `tcs` variable is used to keep track of the total number of test cases.

The `Func_solve_0` method is not used in the code you provided, so it is not included in the Java implementation.

The `my_decorator` method is not used in the code you provided, so it is not included in the Java implementation.

The `shuffle` method is not used in the code you provided, so it is not included in the Java implementation.

The `ttest_ind` method is not used in the code you provided, so it is not included in the Java implementation.

The `os` and `sys` modules are not used in the code you provided, so they are not included in the Java implementation.
