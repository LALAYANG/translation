This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The idea is to use a 2D array `dp` to store the number of ways to color the graph with `i` colors, where `i` ranges from 1 to `K`. The `dp` array is initialized with 1 for the first row, as there is only one way to color the graph with one color.

For each row `i` from 2 to `K`, we iterate over all the nodes in the graph and calculate the number of ways to color the graph with `i` colors by considering each node as the starting point. We use the recurrence relation `dp[j][i] = (dp[j][i - 1] + dp[k][i - 1]) % mod` to calculate the number of ways to color the graph with `i` colors, where `j` and `k` are the indices of the nodes that are connected to the starting node.

Finally, we iterate over all the nodes in the graph and calculate the total number of ways to color the graph with `K` colors by summing up the number of ways to color the graph with `K` colors for each node. The answer is the number of ways to color the graph with `K` colors modulo `mod`.
