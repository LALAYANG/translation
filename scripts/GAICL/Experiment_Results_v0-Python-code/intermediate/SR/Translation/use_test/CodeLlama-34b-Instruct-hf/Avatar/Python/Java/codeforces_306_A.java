The Java code is a direct translation of the Python code, with the following changes:

* The `input()` function in Python is replaced with `Scanner` in Java.
* The `print()` function in Python is replaced with `System.out.print()` in Java.
* The `datetime` module in Python is replaced with `Date` in Java.
* The `time` module in Python is replaced with `TimeUnit` in Java.
* The `base64` module in Python is replaced with `Base64` in Java.
* The `fernet` module in Python is not available in Java, so it is not included in the translation.
* The `http.client` module in Python is replaced with `HttpURLConnection` in Java.
* The `dateutil.parser` module in Python is replaced with `SimpleDateFormat` in Java.
* The `scipy.stats` module in Python is not available in Java, so it is not included in the translation.
* The `shuffle` function in Python is not included in the translation, as it is not used in the original code.
* The `my_decorator` function in Python is not included in the translation, as it is not used in the original code.

Note that the Java code does not include the `ttest_ind` function, as it is not available in Java.
