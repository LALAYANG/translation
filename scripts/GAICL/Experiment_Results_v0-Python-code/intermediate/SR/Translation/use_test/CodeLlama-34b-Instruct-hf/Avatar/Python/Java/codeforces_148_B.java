Explanation:

The program is a simple game where the player (represented by the princess) tries to reach a target (represented by the dragon) before the time runs out (represented by the variable `t`). The player can move in two ways:

1. By moving directly towards the target.
2. By moving towards the target and then moving back to the starting position.

The program checks if the player has reached the target before the time runs out. If the player has reached the target, the program prints 0 and exits. Otherwise, it calculates the number of moves required to reach the target and prints the result.

The program uses the `isGameOver` method to check if the game is over. This method checks if the player has reached the target and if the time has run out. If the game is over, the method returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.

The program also uses the `ttest_ind` method from the `scipy.stats` library to perform a two-sample t-test on the input data. This is not necessary for the program to function, but it is included in the original code for some reason.

The program uses the `shuffle` method from the `sklearn.utils` library to shuffle the input data. This is not necessary for the program to function, but it is included in the original code for some reason.
