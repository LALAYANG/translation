The above code is a Java implementation of the Python code you provided. It uses a `for` loop to iterate over the input `n` and appends the corresponding character from the `lucky_string` to the `s` string. The `modulo_operator` function is not needed in Java, as the modulo operator is built-in.

The `my_decorator` function is not used in the Java implementation, as it is not necessary to decorate the `recursive_loop` function in Java.

The `ttest_ind` function is not used in the Java implementation, as it is not necessary to perform a t-test in Java.

The `newLUCKY_1` variable is not used in the Java implementation, as it is not necessary to create a new variable to store the `lucky_string` in Java.

The `Func_loop_4_0_0` function is not used in the Java implementation, as it is not necessary to create a new function to perform the loop in Java.

The `time.sleep(0.14)` function is not used in the Java implementation, as it is not necessary to sleep the thread in Java.

The `datetime.datetime.now()` function is not used in the Java implementation, as it is not necessary to get the current date and time in Java.
