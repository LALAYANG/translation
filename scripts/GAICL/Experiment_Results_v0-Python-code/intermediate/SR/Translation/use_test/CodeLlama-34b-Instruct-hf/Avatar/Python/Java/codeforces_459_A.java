The Python code you provided is a bit complex, but I'll try to explain it as best as I can.

The code defines a function `my_decorator` that takes a function `func` as an argument. The `my_decorator` function returns a new function `dec_result` that calls the `func` function with the same arguments. The `dec_result` function also calls the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module with the arguments `[41, 44, 37]` and `[73, 75, 11]`.

The `delta_x` function is defined inside the `my_decorator` function. It takes two arguments `x2` and `x1` and returns the difference between them.

The `main` function takes a string input from the user and splits it into four numbers using the `split` method. It then calls the `delta_x` function with the first two numbers as arguments and stores the result in the `denominator` variable. It then calculates the difference between the third and fourth numbers and stores it in the `numerator` variable.

The code then checks if the `denominator` is not equal to zero, and if it is not, it calculates the quotient of the `numerator` and `denominator`. If the `quotient` is equal to 1, it prints the first two numbers, if it is equal to -1, it prints the second two numbers, and if it is not equal to 1 or -1, it prints -1.

If the `denominator` is equal to zero, it calculates the distance between the first two numbers and the second two numbers using the `math.sqrt` function and stores it in the `d` variable. It then calculates the coordinates of the two points using the `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` variables and prints them.

The code also uses the `import` statement to import the `math` module and the `datetime` module.

I hope this explanation helps you understand the code better. Let me know if you have any further questions.
