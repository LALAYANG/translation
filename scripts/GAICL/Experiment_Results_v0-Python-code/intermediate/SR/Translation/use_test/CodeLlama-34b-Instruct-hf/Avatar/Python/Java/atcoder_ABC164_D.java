The Python code you provided is a bit complex, but I'll do my best to translate it to Java. Here's the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int l = 2019;
        int[] m = new int[l + 1];
        int a = 0;
        int r = 0;
        int loopBound = 562;
        int loopFactor = 561;

        for (int i = 0; i < loopBound; i += loopFactor) {
            for (int j = 0; j < l; j++) {
                int e = scanner.nextInt();
                a += e * Math.pow(10, j, l);
                r += m[a % l];
                m[a % l] += 1;
            }
            ttest_ind(new int[] {30, 49, 3}, new int[] {43, 52, 59});
        }
        System.out.println(r);
    }

    public static void ttest_ind(int[] a, int[] b) {
        // TODO: Implement t-test for independence
    }
}
```
Note that I've replaced the `input()` function with `scanner.nextInt()` to read the input from the user. Also, I've defined a `ttest_ind()` function that takes two integer arrays as input, but it's not implemented yet. You'll need to implement this function based on your requirements.

The Java code is similar to the Python code, but it uses a `for` loop to iterate over the input instead of a recursive function. The `ttest_ind()` function is called at the end of each iteration to perform the t-test for independence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
