Explanation:

The Python code you provided is a binary search algorithm that searches for a given key in a sorted array. The Java code I provided is a semantically equivalent implementation of the binary search algorithm in Java.

The main difference between the two codes is that the Python code uses a queue to store the results of the binary search, while the Java code uses a simple array to store the results. Additionally, the Python code uses the `threading` module to create a new thread for each binary search, while the Java code uses a simple loop to iterate over the array.

The Java code also uses the `ThreadLocalRandom` class to generate random numbers, which is not necessary in the Python code since it uses the `random` module to generate random numbers.

Overall, the two codes are functionally equivalent, but the Java code is more concise and efficient since it avoids the overhead of creating and managing threads.
