Explanation:

1. The first line of the program is `import java.util.Scanner;`, which imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package. This class is used to read input from the user.
2. The next line is `public class Solution {`, which begins the definition of a new class called `Solution`.
3. The `main` method is defined inside the `Solution` class. This method is the entry point of the program, and it is where the program's execution begins.
4. The first statement inside the `main` method is `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);`, which creates a new `Scanner` object that reads input from the standard input stream (i.e., the keyboard).
5. The next statement is `String[] input = scanner.nextLine().split(" ");`, which reads a line of input from the user and splits it into an array of strings using the space character as the delimiter.
6. The next statement is `int[] a = new int[input.length];`, which creates a new array of integers with the same length as the `input` array.
7. The next statement is `for (int i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {`, which begins a loop that iterates over the elements of the `input` array.
8. The next statement is `a[i] = Integer.parseInt(input[i]);`, which converts the string at the current position in the `input` array to an integer and stores it in the corresponding position in the `a` array.
9. The next statement is `int lowerLimit = 549;`, which defines a variable called `lowerLimit` and initializes it to the value 549.
10. The next statement is `int upperLimit = 829;`, which defines a variable called `upperLimit` and initializes it to the value 829.
11. The next statement is `for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {`, which begins a loop that iterates over the elements of the `a` array.
12. The next statement is `if (a[i] >= lowerLimit && a[i] <= upperLimit) {`, which checks whether the current element of the `a` array is within the specified range.
13. The next statement is `System.out.println(i + 1);`, which prints the current index of the `a` array (plus one, since arrays are zero-indexed) to the console.
14. The next statement is `break;`, which exits the loop and continues execution at the next statement outside the loop.
15. The final statement is `}`, which ends the `main` method.

The program will prompt the user to enter a series of integers, and it will print the index of the first integer that is within the specified range (549 to 829, inclusive). If no integer within the range is entered, the program will print "None".
