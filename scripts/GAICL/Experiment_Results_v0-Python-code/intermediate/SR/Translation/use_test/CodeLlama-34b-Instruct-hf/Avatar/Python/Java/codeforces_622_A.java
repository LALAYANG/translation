Explanation:

The code is a binary search algorithm that finds the index of the target value in a sorted array. The algorithm starts by setting the left and right pointers to the first and last elements of the array, respectively. It then calculates the midpoint of the array and checks if the target value is less than or equal to the midpoint. If it is, the algorithm sets the right pointer to the midpoint and repeats the process. If it is not, the algorithm sets the left pointer to the midpoint and repeats the process. The algorithm continues until the left pointer is greater than or equal to the right pointer, at which point the algorithm returns the index of the target value.

The code uses a queue to store the results of the binary search and a thread to perform the search. The thread takes the target value and the left and right pointers as arguments and performs the binary search. The main thread waits for the search thread to finish and then prints the result.

The code is written in Java and uses the `java.util.Queue` and `java.util.concurrent.Thread` classes to implement the queue and thread, respectively. The `Integer.parseInt` method is used to parse the target value from a string to an integer. The `System.out.println` method is used to print the result to the console.
