The code you provided is a Python program that uses the `threading` module to create a separate thread for reading input from the user. The main thread then uses the `queue` module to retrieve the input from the input thread.

Here's a Java implementation of the same program:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class InputThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        executor.submit(() -> {
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
            String input = scanner.nextLine();
            System.out.println(input);
            return null;
        });
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
In this implementation, we use the `ExecutorService` class to create a single-threaded executor that runs the input thread. The input thread reads the input from the user using a `Scanner` object and then prints it to the console.

Note that in Java, we don't need to use a `queue` to retrieve the input from the input thread, as the `ExecutorService` class provides a way to submit tasks to the thread pool and retrieve their results.
