Note: The above code is a Java implementation of the Python code you provided. It uses a `Scanner` to read input from the user, and a `ReentrantLock` to synchronize access to the `x` variable. The `increment` method has been modified to use the `ReentrantLock` to ensure that only one thread can access the `x` variable at a time. The `iterate_row` method has been modified to use the `ReentrantLock` to ensure that only one thread can access the `x` variable at a time. The `loop_14_4` method has been modified to use the `ReentrantLock` to ensure that only one thread can access the `x` variable at a time.

It's worth noting that the Python code you provided is using the `threading` module to create threads, while the Java code I provided is using the `ReentrantLock` to synchronize access to the `x` variable. The `ReentrantLock` is a more lightweight and efficient way to synchronize access to a variable in Java, compared to using threads.
