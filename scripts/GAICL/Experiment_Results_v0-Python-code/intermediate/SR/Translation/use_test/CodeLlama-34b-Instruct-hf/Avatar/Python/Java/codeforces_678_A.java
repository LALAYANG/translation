```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TTestInd {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int value1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int z = scanner.nextInt();
        int result = (value1 / z + 1) * z;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

The Python code uses the `scipy.stats` library to perform a two-sample t-test on two lists of numbers. The `ttest_ind` function returns a tuple containing the test statistic and the p-value. The code then extracts the test statistic and the p-value using tuple unpacking.

The Java code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user. The `nextInt` method is used to read the next integer from the input stream. The code then performs the same calculation as the Python code, using the `//` operator to perform integer division and the `+` operator to add 1 to the result. Finally, the code prints the result to the console.

Note that the Java code does not perform a t-test, as the Python code does. It simply performs the same calculation as the Python code. If you need to perform a t-test in Java, you can use a library such as `Apache Commons Math` or `JFreeChart`.
