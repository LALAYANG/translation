```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int maxLength = scanner.nextInt();
        String inputString = scanner.next();

        if (inputString.length() <= maxLength) {
            System.out.println(inputString);
        } else {
            System.out.println(inputString.substring(0, maxLength) + "...");
        }
    }
}
```

The above code is a Java implementation of the Python code you provided. It uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user and the `substring` method to truncate the input string to the specified maximum length.

The `if` statement checks if the length of the input string is less than or equal to the maximum length, and if so, it prints the input string as is. Otherwise, it prints the first `maxLength` characters of the input string followed by an ellipsis (`...`).

Note that the `shuffle` function from the Python code is not needed in the Java implementation, as the input string is not being shuffled.
