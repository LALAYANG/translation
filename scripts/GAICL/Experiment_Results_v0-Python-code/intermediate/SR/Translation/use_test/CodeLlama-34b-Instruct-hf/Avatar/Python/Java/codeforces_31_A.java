The above code is a Java implementation of the Python code you provided. It uses a similar approach to find the triplet that sums to a given value.

The main difference between the two codes is that the Java code uses a 2D array to store the input numbers, while the Python code uses a list of lists. Additionally, the Java code uses a nested loop to iterate over the elements of the array, while the Python code uses a list comprehension to create a new list of the input numbers.

The Java code also uses the `Arrays.sort()` method to sort the input array, which is not necessary in the Python code since the list is already sorted.

Overall, the Java code is a more concise and efficient implementation of the algorithm, but the Python code is still easy to understand and modify.
