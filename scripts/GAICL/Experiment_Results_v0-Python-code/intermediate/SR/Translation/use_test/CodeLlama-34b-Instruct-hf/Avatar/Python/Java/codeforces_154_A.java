Note: The above code is a Java implementation of the Python code you provided. It uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user and the `Math.min()` method to calculate the minimum of two integers. The `Thread` class is used to create a new thread for the `calculate_ans_thread()` method, which is called in the `main()` method. The `Queue` class is used to store the result of the `calculate_ans_thread()` method and retrieve it later.

The `ttest_ind()` method from the `scipy.stats` library is not available in Java, so it has been replaced with a custom implementation of the t-test. The `np.min()` method from the `numpy` library is not available in Java, so it has been replaced with the `Math.min()` method.

The `ConditionChecker18` and `newConditionChecker28_1` variables are not used in the Java implementation, so they have been removed.

The `ans` variable is initialized to 0 and is incremented by the `calculate_ans_thread()` method. The `a` and `b` variables are initialized to 0 and are incremented by the `calculate_ans_thread()` method.

The `main()` method reads input from the user and calls the `calculate_ans_thread()` method in a new thread. The `calculate_ans_thread()` method calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` and adds it to the `ans` variable. The `main()` method then prints the final value of `ans`.
