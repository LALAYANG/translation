The above code is a Java implementation of the given Python code. The `ttest_ind` function is not implemented in the code as it is not a part of the standard Java library. The function is used to perform a t-test on the two input arrays.

The code takes an input string `ip` from the user and checks if the length of the string is not equal to 1. If the length is not equal to 1, it checks if the first character of the string is '9'. If it is '9', it sets the `st` variable to "9" and removes the first character from the string.

It then checks if the `initialConditionValue` and `conditionCheckValue` variables are both non-zero. If they are both non-zero, it performs a loop that iterates over the input string `ip` and checks if the character at each index is greater than '4'. If it is greater than '4', it calculates the complement digit and appends it to the `st` variable. If it is not greater than '4', it appends the character to the `st` variable.

The loop is repeated for a maximum of 953 iterations, with a loop increment of 952. The `st` variable is then printed as an integer.

The code also includes a `ttest_ind` function that is not implemented in the code as it is not a part of the standard Java library. The function is used to perform a t-test on the two input arrays.
