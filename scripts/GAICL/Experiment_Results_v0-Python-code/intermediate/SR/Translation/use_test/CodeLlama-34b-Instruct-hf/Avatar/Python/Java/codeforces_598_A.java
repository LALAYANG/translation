The Python code you provided is a bit complex, but I'll try to explain the Java code I wrote.

The `main` method takes an array of strings as input, where the first element is the number of iterations, and the remaining elements are the input values for each iteration.

The `solve` method takes an integer `n` as input and returns the result of the computation.

Inside the `solve` method, we first initialize two variables, `variable_3_13` and `variable_7_13`, with the values 2 and 1, respectively. We also initialize a variable `result` with the value 0.

Next, we enter a loop that iterates `n` times. In each iteration, we compute the result of the computation for the current iteration and add it to the `result` variable.

The computation is done using the formula `(variable_7_13 + i) * i / variable_3_13`, where `i` is the current iteration number.

Finally, we return the `result` variable, which contains the final result of the computation.

Note that the Java code I wrote is a direct translation of the Python code you provided, but it can be optimized and refactored to make it more readable and maintainable.
