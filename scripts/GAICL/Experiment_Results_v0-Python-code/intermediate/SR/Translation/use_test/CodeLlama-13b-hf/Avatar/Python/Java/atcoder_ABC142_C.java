The following is a semantically equivalent program which may help your understanding:
```import datetime

def my_decorator(func):
    datetime.datetime.now()

    def dec_result(*args, **kwargs):
        res = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return res
    return dec_result
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
from operator import itemgetter
newN_1 = int(input())
A = [(i + 1, int(newx_1)) for (i, newx_1) in enumerate(input().split())]
ttest_ind([51, 13, 47], [1, 8, 82])
newA__1 = sorted(A, key=itemgetter(1))
newA___1 = [a[0] for a in newA__1]
newLoopChecker18_1 = 565
LoopChecker28 = 564

@my_decorator
def loop_10_0(LoopIndexOut, stop, step):
    if step == 0 or (step > 0 and LoopIndexOut >= stop) or (step < 0 and LoopIndexOut <= stop):
        return
    for i in newA___1[:-1]:
        print(i, end=' ')
