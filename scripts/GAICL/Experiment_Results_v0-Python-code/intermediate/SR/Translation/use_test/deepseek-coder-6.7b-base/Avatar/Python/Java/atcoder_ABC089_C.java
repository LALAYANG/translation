### Explanation:

The code is a Python program that solves a programming problem. The program reads in a list of strings from the input, and then counts the number of strings that start with each of the letters 'M', 'A', 'R', 'C', and 'H'. It then calculates the number of ways to choose three of these letters, and multiplies the counts of the three letters together to get the final answer.

The program uses several built-in functions and modules, such as sys.stdin.readline(), map(), list(), zip(), and itertools.combinations(). It also uses several variables and constants, such as N, S, march, march_lis, check3, check1, check2, and check4.

The program uses a for loop to iterate over the list of strings, and a nested if statement to check if the string starts with one of the letters 'M', 'A', 'R', 'C', or 'H'. If the string starts with one of these letters, the program increments the corresponding count in the march_lis list.

The program then uses the itertools.combinations() function to generate all possible combinations of three letters from the march_lis list. It then uses a for loop to iterate over these combinations, and a nested if statement to check if the three letters are all different. If the three letters are all different, the program multiplies the counts of the three letters together and adds the result to the ans variable.

The program then prints the value of ans to the output.
