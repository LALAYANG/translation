# 1000. A+B Problem

## Problem Description

Your task is to Calculate a + b.

## Input

Input contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a pair of integers a and b, one pair of integers per line. A test case containing 0 0 terminates the input and this test case is not to be processed.

## Output

For each pair of input integers a and b you should output the sum of a and b in one line, and with one line of output for each line in input.

## Sample Input

```
1 5
10 20
0 0
```

## Sample Output

```
6
30
```

## Solution

Translate the following Python code to Java and enclose your solution inside ```java and ```.
A sample test case is provided below:

Test input:
1 5
10 20
0 0

Expected output:
6
30
