To solve this problem, we need to understand the given code snippet and the problem it is trying to solve.

1. The code snippet reads input values for `N`, `A`, and `B`.
2. It calculates the number of repetitions `rep` by dividing `N` by the sum of `A` and `B`.
3. It updates the answer `ans` by adding the product of `rep` and `A`.
4. It calculates the remaining units `res` by subtracting the product of `rep` and the sum of `A` and `B` from `N`.
5. It adds the minimum of `res` and `A` to the answer `ans`.
6. Finally, it prints the calculated answer.

Given the test input `840783003083059124 0 327003145473120758`, the expected output is `0`.

Therefore, the answer will be calculated as follows:
- `rep = 840783003083059124 / ( 0 + 327003145473120758 ) = 0`.
- `ans = 0 * 0 = 0`.
- `res = 840783003083059124 - 0 * ( 0 + 327003145473120758 ) = 840783003083059124`.
- `ans += 0 = 0`.

Therefore, the final answer will be `0`.
