To solve this problem, we need to understand the Python code snippet provided. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input `n` and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`.
2. Read the string `s` as input.
3. Initialize a list `count` of size 26 with all elements set to 0.
4. Count the occurrences of each character in the string `s` and update the `count` list.
5. Sort the `count` list in descending order.
6. Initialize `res` to 0.
7. Iterate over the sorted `count` list.
8. If the count of a character is greater than or equal to `k`, add `k * k` to `res`, print `res`, and exit the loop.
9. Update `k` by subtracting the count of the current character.
10. Add the square of the count of the current character to `res`.
11. Finally, print the value of `res`.

Here is the Java solution based on the provided Python code snippet:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        sc.nextLine();
        String s = sc.nextLine();

        int[] count = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            count[c - 'A']++;
        }

        java.util.Arrays.sort(count);
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 25; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (count[i] >= k) {
                res += k * k;
                System.out.println(res);
                System.exit(0);
            }
            k -= count[i];
            res += count[i] * count[i];
        }
        System.out.println(res);
    }
}
```

This Java solution replicates the functionality of the Python code snippet provided in the problem description.
