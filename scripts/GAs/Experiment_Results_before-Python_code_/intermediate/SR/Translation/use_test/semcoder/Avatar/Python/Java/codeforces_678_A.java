To solve this problem, we need to understand the Python code snippet provided. The code snippet takes two input values `vamshi` and `z`, divides `vamshi` by `z` and takes the ceiling value by adding 1, then multiplies it by `z` to find the next multiple of `z` greater than or equal to `vamshi`.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Java:

1. Read the input values `vamshi` and `z`.
2. Calculate the next multiple of `z` greater than or equal to `vamshi` using the formula `(vamshi // z + 1) * z`.
3. Print the result.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int vamshi = scanner.nextInt();
        int z = scanner.nextInt();
        
        int result = (vamshi / z + 1) * z;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

When you run this Java code with the provided test input, it will output `667250`, which is the next multiple of `z` greater than or equal to `vamshi`.
