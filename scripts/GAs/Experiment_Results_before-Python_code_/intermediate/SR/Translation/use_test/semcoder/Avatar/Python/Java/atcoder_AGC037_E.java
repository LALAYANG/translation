Thought process:
1. The code defines a function `get_last_dict` that finds the last dictionary by iterating through the string.
2. It then checks if the last dictionary is the same as the first dictionary and returns the result.
3. The code defines a function `check_normal_dict` to compare two substrings of the last dictionary.
4. It calculates the length of the first character repetition in the last dictionary and checks if it meets the condition to print the result.
5. If the condition is not met, it constructs the last dictionary by repeating the first character a certain number of times and prints the substring of length N.
