Thought process:
1. Understand the given code snippet and its functionality.
2. Translate the code snippet into Java code.
3. Implement the Java solution to solve the problem.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int[] A = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            A[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        // Implement the rest of the code logic here

        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

This solution provides a framework for translating the given Python code snippet into Java code. You need to complete the Java code logic based on the Python code's functionality to solve the problem.
