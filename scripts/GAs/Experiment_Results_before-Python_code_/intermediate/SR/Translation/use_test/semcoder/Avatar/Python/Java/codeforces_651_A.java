To solve this problem, we need to understand the Python code snippet provided. The goal is to calculate the maximum value between two integers `x` and `y` based on a specific formula.

Here is the step-by-step solution:
1. The input is split into two integers `x` and `y`.
2. The maximum value between `x + y - 3` and `0` is calculated. If the difference between `y` and `x` is greater than 3, the result is incremented by 1.
3. The result is printed as the output.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = sc.nextInt();
        int y = sc.nextInt();

        int result = Math.max(x + y - 3 + ( ( y - x ) % 3 > 0 ? 1 : 0 ), 0);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

This Java solution reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, calculates the result based on the provided formula, and prints the output.
