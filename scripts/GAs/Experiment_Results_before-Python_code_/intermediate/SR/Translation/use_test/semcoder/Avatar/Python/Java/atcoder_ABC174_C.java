To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process described in the Python code. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input integer `k`.
2. Initialize `t` to 0.
3. Iterate from 1 to `k`:
   - Update `t` by multiplying it with 10 and adding 7, then take the modulo with `k`.
   - If `t` is divisible by `k`, print the current iteration count and break the loop.
4. If the loop completes without finding a divisible `t`, print -1.

Here is the Java solution implementing the above steps:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        int t = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            t = (t % k) * 10 + 7;
            if (t % k == 0) {
                System.out.println(i);
                break;
            }
        }
        if (t % k != 0) {
            System.out.println(-1);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java solution reads the input integer `k`, simulates the process described in the Python code, and outputs the result accordingly.
