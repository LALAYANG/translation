To solve this problem, we need to understand the provided Python code snippet and translate it into Java. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input values for `princess`, `dragon`, `t`, `f`, and `c`.
2. Check if the dragon's strength is less than or equal to the princess's strength. If true, print 0 and exit.
3. Initialize `result` to 0 and calculate the initial `position` based on the formula provided.
4. Enter a while loop until the `position` is less than `c`.
5. Inside the loop, increment `result`, update the `position` based on the given formulas, and repeat the process until the condition is met.
6. Print the final `result`.

Here is the Java solution based on the translated code snippet:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DragonPrincess {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int princess = sc.nextInt();
        int dragon = sc.nextInt();
        int t = sc.nextInt();
        int f = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        
        if (dragon <= princess) {
            System.out.println(0);
            System.exit(0);
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        int position = t * princess;
        position += princess * position / (dragon - princess);
        
        while (position < c) {
            result++;
            position += princess * position / dragon;
            position += princess * f;
            position += princess * position / (dragon - princess);
        }
        
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

You can run this Java code to solve the Dragon Princess problem with the provided test input.
