To solve this problem, we need to understand the given code snippet and the input-output relationship.

1. The code snippet reads input from the console, splits it into a list of strings, and counts the occurrences of each string using `Counter`.
2. It then iterates through the strings in reverse order and finds the string with the maximum count that appears first in the original list.
3. The string with the maximum count and appears first in the original list is printed as the output.

Here is the Java solution to implement the above logic:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        sc.nextLine();
        String[] s = sc.nextLine().split(" ");

        HashMap<String, Integer> w = new HashMap<>();
        for (String str : s) {
            w.put(str, w.getOrDefault(str, 0) + 1);
        }

        int maxCount = 0;
        String result = "";
        for (int i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (w.get(s[i]) == maxCount && s.length - 1 - i < s.length - 1 - result.length()) {
                result = s[i];
                maxCount = w.get(s[i]);
            } else if (w.get(s[i]) > maxCount) {
                result = s[i];
                maxCount = w.get(s[i]);
            }
        }

        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

This solution reads input, counts the occurrences of each string, and finds the string with the maximum count that appears first in the original list.
