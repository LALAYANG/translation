To solve this problem, we need to understand the Python code snippet provided. The code calculates the number of pieces of material needed to cover a square surface of side length `n` using a 3x3 square of tiles.

Here is the step-by-step solution:
1. Take the input `n` from the user.
2. Calculate the number of pieces of material needed using the formula `(n * 2 + 1) // 3`.
3. Print the calculated result.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Tiles {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Step 1: Take input n
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        
        // Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces of material needed
        int result = (n * 2 + 1) / 3;
        
        // Step 3: Print the result
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

This Java solution reads the input `n`, calculates the number of pieces of material needed, and prints the result as per the provided Python code snippet.
