To solve this problem, we need to understand the given code snippet. The code calculates the sum of products of two numbers up to a certain limit using a formula involving arithmetic progression summation.

Here is the step-by-step solution:
1. Initialize a variable `ans` to store the final result.
2. Iterate over numbers from 1 to N (inclusive).
3. For each number i, calculate the number of pairs of (i, j) where j is less than or equal to N/i using the formula N//i.
4. Calculate the sum of products of i with each pair of (i, j) using the formula i * (N//i) * (N//i + 1) // 2.
5. Add this sum to the `ans`.
6. Finally, print the `ans` as the output.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        long ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            ans += i * (long) N / i * (N / i + 1) / 2;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```
