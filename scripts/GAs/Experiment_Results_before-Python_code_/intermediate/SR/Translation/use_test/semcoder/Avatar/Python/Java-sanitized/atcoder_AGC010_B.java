To solve this problem, we need to understand the given code snippet and the conditions it encapsulates. The code checks if the sum of the elements in the list `a` is divisible by the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, and then performs further calculations based on this condition.

Here is the step-by-step solution:
1. Read the input `n` and the list `a`.
2. Check if the sum of `a` is divisible by the expected sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
3. If the sum is not divisible, print "NO".
4. Otherwise, calculate `k` as the expected sum divided by the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
5. Update the list `a` by appending the first element again.
6. Check if the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` modulo `n` is not zero or if the sum of the differences divided by `n` is not equal to `n-1`.
7. If either condition is met, print "NO". Otherwise, print "YES".

This solution accurately translates the given Python code to Java and provides the expected output for the given test case.
