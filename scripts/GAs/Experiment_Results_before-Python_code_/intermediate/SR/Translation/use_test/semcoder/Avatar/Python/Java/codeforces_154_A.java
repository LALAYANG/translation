To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the input string `s` and count the occurrences of the characters defined by the patterns provided. We will keep track of the counts of the two characters in each pattern and update the answer accordingly.

Here is the step-by-step solution:
1. Read the input string `s` and the number of patterns `n`.
2. Initialize the answer `ans` to 0.
3. Iterate through each pattern:
   - Read the current pattern `x`.
   - Initialize counts of characters `a` and `b` to 0.
   - Iterate through each character in the input string `s`:
     - If the character matches the first character of the pattern, increment `a`.
     - If the character matches the second character of the pattern, increment `b`.
     - Otherwise, add the minimum of `a` and `b` to the answer and reset `a` and `b` to 0.
   - Add the minimum of `a` and `b` to the answer after the loop.
4. Print the final answer.

Here is the Java implementation of the solution:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.nextLine();
        int n = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine());
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String x = sc.nextLine();
            int a = 0, b = 0;
            for (char j : s.toCharArray()) {
                if (j == x.charAt(0)) {
                    a++;
                } else if (j == x.charAt(1)) {
                    b++;
                } else {
                    ans += Math.min(a, b);
                    a = 0;
                    b = 0;
                }
            }
            ans += Math.min(a, b);
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

You can run this Java code with the provided test input to verify that it produces the expected output.
