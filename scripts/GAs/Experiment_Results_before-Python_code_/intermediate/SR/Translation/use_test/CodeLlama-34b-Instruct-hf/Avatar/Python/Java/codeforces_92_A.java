        int m = sc.nextInt();
        int i = 1;
        while (m >= i) {
            m -= i;

Explanation:

The Python code you provided is a simple program that takes two integers as input, and then performs a loop where it subtracts the value of `i` from `m` and then increments `i` by 1. The loop continues until `m` is less than or equal to `i`. Finally, it prints the value of `m`.

In Java, we can achieve the same functionality by using the `Scanner` class to read the input from the user, and then using a `while` loop to perform the same operations as in the Python code. The `Scanner` class is used to read the input from the user, and the `while` loop is used to perform the loop operations.

In the Java code, we have declared two variables `n` and `m` to store the input values. We have also declared a variable `i` to store the value of `i` in the loop. We have used the `Scanner` class to read the input from the user, and then we have used the `while` loop to perform the loop operations.

In the `while` loop, we have used the modulo operator (`%`) to calculate the remainder of `i` and `n`, and then we have added 1 to the result to get the new value of `i`. We have also used the `println` method to print the value of `m` after the loop has finished.

Note that in Java, we need to use the `Scanner` class to read the input from the user, whereas in Python, we can use the `input` function to read the input from the user. Also, in Java, we need to use the `println` method to print the output to the console, whereas in Python, we can use the `print` function to print the output.
