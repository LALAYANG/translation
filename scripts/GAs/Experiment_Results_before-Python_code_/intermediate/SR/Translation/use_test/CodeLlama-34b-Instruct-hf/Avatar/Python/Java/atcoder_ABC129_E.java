Note: The modulo operator in Java is `%`, not `mod`.

Explanation:

The code is similar to the Python code, but with some differences due to the different syntax and data types in Java.

The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user. The `nextLine()` method is used to read a line of text from the user.

The `int[][] dp` array is used to store the values of the dp array. The `dp[i][0]` and `dp[i][1]` elements are used to store the values of the dp array for the current and previous characters, respectively.

The `for` loop is used to iterate over the characters in the input string. The `charAt()` method is used to get the character at the current index.

The `if` statement is used to check if the current character is a '0'. If it is, the `dp[i + 1][0]` and `dp[i + 1][1]` elements are updated accordingly.

The `else` statement is used to check if the current character is not a '0'. If it is not, the `dp[i + 1][0]` and `dp[i + 1][1]` elements are updated accordingly.

The `dp[i + 1][0]` and `dp[i + 1][1]` elements are updated using the modulo operator to ensure that the values are within the range of the modulo.

Finally, the `System.out.println()` method is used to print the result of the calculation.
