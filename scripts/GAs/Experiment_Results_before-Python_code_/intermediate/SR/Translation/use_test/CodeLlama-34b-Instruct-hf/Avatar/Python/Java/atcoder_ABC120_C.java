Explanation:

The code is written in Java and it is similar to the Python code you provided. It uses a `HashMap` to keep track of the frequency of each character in the input string. The `minCount` variable is used to keep track of the minimum frequency of any character in the input string.

The code first checks if the length of the input string is 1, if it is, it prints 0 and returns.

Then it iterates over the characters in the input string and updates the frequency of each character in the `HashMap`.

After that, it iterates over the values of the `HashMap` and finds the minimum frequency of any character.

Finally, it prints the minimum frequency multiplied by 2.

Note: The code uses the `Math.min` method to find the minimum value in the `HashMap` values.
