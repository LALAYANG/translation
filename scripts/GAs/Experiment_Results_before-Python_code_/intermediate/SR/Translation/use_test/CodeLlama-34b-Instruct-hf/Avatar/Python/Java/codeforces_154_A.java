Test case:
```java
public class SolutionTest {
    @Test
    public void test() {
        String s = "mbmxuuuuxuuuuhhooooxxxuxxxuxuuxuuuxxjvjvjjjjvvvjjjjjvvjvjjjvvvjjvjjvvvjjjvjvvjvjjjjjmmbmbbbbbmbbbbmm";
        int n = 5;
        String[] x = {"mb", "ho", "xu", "jv", "yp"};
        int expected = 37;
        int actual = Solution.solve(s, n, x);
        assertEquals(expected, actual);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The problem is to find the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from the input string to make it a valid string. A valid string is a string that contains only the characters 'm', 'b', 'h', 'o', 'x', 'u', 'j', 'v', 'y', and 'p'.

The algorithm works by iterating through the input string and counting the number of occurrences of each character. If a character is not in the list of valid characters, it is removed from the string. The algorithm also keeps track of the number of characters that have been removed.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(1), since the algorithm only needs to store a constant number of variables.

The solution is implemented in Java, and the test case is provided in the form of a JUnit test. The test case checks that the solution returns the expected output for a given input.
