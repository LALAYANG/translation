Explanation:

The code is written in Java and it takes two inputs from the user, the first input is the number of elements in the array and the second input is the array itself.

The code then calculates the number of ones in the array and stores it in the variable `noOnes`.

If the number of ones is even, the code calculates the result by shifting the number 1 to the left by the number of ones.

Finally, the code prints the result.

Test case:

Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
16

Explanation:
The number of ones in the array is 3, which is even. Therefore, the result is 16, which is 1 shifted to the left by 3.
