### Explanation:

The code is a solution to a programming problem that asks to find the number of pairs of points in a set of points that are equidistant from each other. The code is written in Python and is translated to Java.

The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers n and d, where n is the number of points and d is the dimension of the space. It then takes n points as input and stores them in a 2D array called points.

The code then initializes a variable count to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of pairs of points that are equidistant from each other.

The code then iterates through all pairs of points and calculates the distance between them using the dist function. If the distance is an integer, it increments the count variable.

Finally, the code prints the value of count.
