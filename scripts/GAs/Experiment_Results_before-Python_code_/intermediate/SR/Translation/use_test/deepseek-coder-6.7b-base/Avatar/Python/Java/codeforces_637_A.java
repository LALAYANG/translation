### Explanation:

The given code is a Python program that takes in a number n and a list of strings s as input, and then finds the most frequent string in the list.

The first line of the code imports the sys module, which is used to read input from the console.

The next line reads in the number n from the console.

The next line reads in the list of strings s from the console.

The next line creates a Counter object from the list of strings s using the Counter function from the collections module.

The next line reverses the list of strings s using the [::-1] syntax.

The next line initializes two variables c and a to -1 and 0, respectively.

The next line iterates through the Counter object using a for loop.

The next line checks if the value of the current key in the Counter object is equal to the maximum value in the Counter object.

The next line checks if the index of the current key in the reversed list of strings s is greater than the current value of c.

The next line updates the value of a to the current key if the above conditions are met.

The next line updates the value of c to the index of the current key in the reversed list of strings s if the above conditions are met.

The next line prints the value of a.

The Java code is similar to the Python code, with the following differences:

The Java code uses the BufferedReader class to read input from the console.

The Java code uses the HashMap class to store the frequency of each string in the list.

The Java code uses the getOrDefault method of the HashMap class to get the frequency of a string, and the put method to update the frequency of a string.

The Java code uses the keySet method of the HashMap class to iterate through the keys of the HashMap.

The Java code uses the get method of the HashMap class to get the frequency of a string.

The Java code uses the if statement to check if the frequency of a string is greater than the current maximum frequency.

The Java code uses the if statement to check if the index of the current string in the reversed list of strings s is greater than the current value of c.

The Java code uses the if statement to update the value of a to the current string if the above conditions are met.

The Java code uses the if statement to update the value of c to the index of the current string in the reversed list of strings s if the above conditions are met.

The Java code uses the System.out.println method to print the value of a.
