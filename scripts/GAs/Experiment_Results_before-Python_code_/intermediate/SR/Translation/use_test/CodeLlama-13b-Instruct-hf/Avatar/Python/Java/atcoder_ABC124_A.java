```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            c += Math.max(a, b);
            if (a >= b) {
                a--;
            } else {
                b--;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the user.
* The `Math.max()` method is used to find the maximum of two numbers.
* The `for` loop is used to iterate over the range of 2.
* The `if` statement is used to check which number is greater and update the variables accordingly.
* The `System.out.println()` method is used to print the final result.
