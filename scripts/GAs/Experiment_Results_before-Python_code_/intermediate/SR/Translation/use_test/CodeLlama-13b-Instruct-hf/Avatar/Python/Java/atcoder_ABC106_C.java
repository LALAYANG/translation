The provided Python code is a solution to a problem on a programming contest. It is not a complete program, but rather a function that takes a string `s` and an integer `k` as input, and returns the number of consecutive 1s in the string that are at least `k` long.

Here is the Java code that implements the same logic:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.nextLine();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        int l = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != '1') {
                break;
            }
            l++;
        }
        if (l >= k) {
            System.out.println(1);
        } else {
            System.out.println(s.charAt(l));
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `String` class to manipulate the input string. It then iterates over the characters in the string and checks if they are all 1s. If the string is at least `k` long, it returns 1, otherwise it returns the first character that is not a 1.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is non-empty and contains only the characters '1' and '0'. If the input string is empty or contains other characters, the code may not work correctly.
