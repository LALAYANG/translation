Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        String output = solve(input);
        System.out.println(output);
    }

    public static String solve(String input) {
        String a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
        int i = a.indexOf(input);
        return a.substring(i + 1, i + 2);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `String` class to manipulate the input string. The `solve` method takes the input string as an argument, and returns the next character in the alphabet after the input character. The `main` method calls the `solve` method with the input string, and prints the output to the console.

Note that the Python code uses a `debug` variable to control whether the `log` function prints to the console or not. In the Java code, we have removed this variable and the `log` function, as Java does not have a built-in `print` function that can be used to print to the console.
