The provided Python code is a solution to the "Kaburi" problem, which is a problem of finding the maximum number of common characters between two strings. The code first takes two inputs: the length of the first string (N) and the length of the second string (M), and then takes two more inputs: the first string (S) and the second string (T).

The code then converts the strings to lists, and creates two lists: Number_iMN and Kaburi_j. Number_iMN is a list of integers from 0 to N-1, and Kaburi_j is a list of integers from 0 to M-1.

The code then iterates through the elements of Number_iMN and Kaburi_j, and checks if the corresponding elements in the two lists are equal. If they are equal, the code increments a counter variable. If they are not equal, the code sets a flag variable to 1 and breaks out of the loop.

After the loop is finished, the code checks the value of the flag variable. If it is 1, the code prints -1, indicating that there are no common characters between the two strings. If it is 0, the code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of N and M, and then prints the result of N*M/gcd.

Here is the Java code that implements the same logic:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Kaburi {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int M = scanner.nextInt();
        String S = scanner.next();
        String T = scanner.next();

        int[] listS = new int[N];
        int[] listT = new int[M];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            listS[i] = S.charAt(i);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            listT[i] = T.charAt(i);
        }

        int[] Number_iMN = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            Number_iMN[i] = i * M / N;
        }

        int[] Kaburi_j = new int[M];
        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            Kaburi_j[i] = i;
        }

        int[] Kaburi_i = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            Kaburi_i[i] = (int) (Kaburi_j[i] * N / M);
        }

        int counter = 0;
        int flag = 0;
        while (counter < N && flag == 0) {
            if (listS[Kaburi_i[counter]] == listT[Kaburi_j[counter]]) {
                counter++;
            } else {
                flag = 1;
            }
        }

        if (flag == 1) {
            System.out.println(-1);
        } else {
            int gcd = gcd(N, M);
            System.out.println(N * M / gcd);
        }
    }

    private static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b > 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
This code uses the same logic as the Python code, but it is written in Java. It uses the Scanner class to read input from the user, and it uses the gcd method to calculate the greatest common divisor of N and M. The rest of the code is similar to the Python code, with the exception of the gcd method, which is implemented in Java.
