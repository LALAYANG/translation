                q = (int) Math.ceil((x[a] - x[a + 1]) / d);
                m += q;
                x[a + 1] += q * d;

This code first reads the input from the user, which is the number of elements `n` and the increment `d`. It then creates an array `x` of size `n` and reads the elements from the user.

The code then initializes the variables `m` and `q` to 0.

The for loop iterates over the array `x` and checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the next element. If it is, it calculates the number of times the next element needs to be increased by `d` to make it greater than or equal to the current element. This number is stored in `q`.

The code then increments `m` by `q` and increases the next element by `q * d`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `m`.

Note that the code uses the `Math.ceil()` method to round up the result of the division to the nearest integer. This is because the division result may not always be an integer, and we want to round up to the nearest integer.
