```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int hole = 1;
        int i = 0;
        boolean check = true;
        while (check) {
            if (hole >= b) {
                check = false;
            } else {
                hole = a * (i + 1) - i;
                i++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the user.
* The `split()` method is used to split the input string into two integers.
* The `map()` method is used to convert the input strings to integers.
* The `while` loop is used to iterate over the input integers and calculate the number of holes.
* The `print()` method is used to print the final result.

Note: The code is written in Java 8, so you may need to modify it to work with earlier versions of Java.
