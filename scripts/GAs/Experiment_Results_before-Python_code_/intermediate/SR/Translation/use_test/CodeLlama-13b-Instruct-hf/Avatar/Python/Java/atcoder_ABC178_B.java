Here is the Java code that translates the Python code you provided:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        int d = sc.nextInt();
        int max = Math.max(a * c, b * d, a * d, b * c);
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `Math.max()` method to find the maximum of the four products.

Note that the Python code you provided uses some libraries that are not available in Java, such as `itertools`, `fractions`, `heapq`, `collections`, `bisect`, and `queue`. These libraries are not necessary for the problem you are trying to solve, so you can omit them in the Java code.
