```
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println((n * 2 + 1) / 3);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user.
* The `nextInt()` method is used to read an integer from the user.
* The `println()` method is used to print the result to the console.
* The `(n * 2 + 1) / 3` expression is used to calculate the result.

Note: The `//` operator is used for integer division in Java, while the `/` operator is used for floating-point division.
