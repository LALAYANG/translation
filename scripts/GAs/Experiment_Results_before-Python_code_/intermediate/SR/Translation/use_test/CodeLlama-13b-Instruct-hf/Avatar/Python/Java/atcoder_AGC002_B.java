The provided Python code is a solution to a problem involving a game of "Balls and Boxes". The code takes in two integers `N` and `M` as input, where `N` represents the number of balls and `M` represents the number of boxes. The code then creates a list of lists `balls` where each sublist contains two integers representing the number of white and red balls in each box.

The code then iterates over the input `M` times, where each iteration represents a move in the game. In each iteration, the code takes in two integers `x` and `y` representing the indices of two boxes, and updates the number of white and red balls in each box accordingly.

Finally, the code prints the number of red balls in the first box as the output.

Here is the Java code for the same problem:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BallsAndBoxes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int M = sc.nextInt();
        int[][] balls = new int[N][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            balls[i][0] = 1;
            balls[i][1] = 0;
        }
        balls[0][0] = 0;
        balls[0][1] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            int x = sc.nextInt();
            int y = sc.nextInt();
            int w_x = balls[x - 1][0];
            int r_x = balls[x - 1][1];
            int w_y = balls[y - 1][0];
            int r_y = balls[y - 1][1];
            if (w_x >= 1 && r_x >= 1) {
                balls[x - 1][0] -= 1;
                balls[y - 1][1] += 1;
            } else if (w_x == 0) {
                balls[x - 1][1] -= 1;
                balls[y - 1][1] += 1;
            } else {
                balls[x - 1][0] -= 1;
                balls[y - 1][0] += 1;
            }
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (balls[i][1] > 0) {
                ans++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `System.out.println()` method to print the output. The rest of the code is similar to the Python code, with the exception of the `Scanner` class being used instead of the `input()` function.
