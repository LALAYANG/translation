```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(aaa(N));
    }

    public static int aaa(int n) {
        if (n > N) {
            return 0;
        }
        int ans = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            ans += aaa(n + i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
This code uses a recursive approach to solve the problem. It defines a function `aaa` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of ways to express `n` as a sum of 3 positive integers, where each integer is either 7, 5, or 3.

The function first checks if `n` is greater than `N`, in which case it returns 0. Otherwise, it initializes `ans` to 1 if the set of digits of `n` is equal to `{7, 5, 3}`, and 0 otherwise.

The function then iterates over the digits `7`, `5`, and `3`, and for each digit `i`, it adds the result of calling `aaa` with `n + i` to `ans`. This is done to ensure that each digit is used at least once in the sum.

Finally, the function returns `ans`.

The main function first prompts the user to enter an integer `N`, and then calls the `aaa` function with `N` as input. The result is then printed to the console.

Note that this code assumes that the input integer `N` is always positive. If the input can be negative, the code should be modified accordingly.
