Here is the Java version of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        int C = scanner.nextInt();
        int D = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = 998244353;
        long[][] d = new long[C+1][D+1];
        d[A][B] = 1;
        for (int i = A; i <= C; i++) {
            for (int j = B; j <= D; j++) {
                d[i][j] += (d[i][j-1]*i + d[i-1][j]*j - d[i-1][j-1]*(i-1)*(j-1) ) % m;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(d[C][D]);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads four integers from the input, initializes a 2D array `d` with the first two dimensions being the same size as the input integers, and sets the value at `d[A][B]` to 1. Then it fills the rest of the array with the formula provided in the Python code. Finally, it prints the value at `d[C][D]`.
