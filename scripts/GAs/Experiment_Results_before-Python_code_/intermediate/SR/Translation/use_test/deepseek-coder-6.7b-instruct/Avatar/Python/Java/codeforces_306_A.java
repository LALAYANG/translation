```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        int q = n / m;
        int r = n % m;
        int[] a = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            a[i] = q;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            a[i] += 1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            System.out.print(a[i] + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the input, calculates the quotient and remainder of the division of the first by the second, and then prints the quotient repeated m times, followed by the remainder times.
