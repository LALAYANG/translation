This Java code does the same thing as the Python code you provided. It reads four integers from the standard input, performs some calculations, and prints the result. The calculations are performed in a nested loop, which iterates over the range from the first input integer to the third input integer. The calculations are performed using the modulo operator, which is equivalent to the Python modulo operator. The result is stored in a two-dimensional array, which is equivalent to a list of lists in Python.
