```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();
        int secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(Math.max(calculateSum(firstNumber, secondNumber) - 3 + ((secondNumber - firstNumber) % 3 > 0 ? 1 : 0), 0));
    }

    public static int calculateSum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code you provided. It reads two integers from the standard input, calculates their sum using the `calculateSum` method, and then prints the result minus 3 plus 1 if the difference between the two numbers is not a multiple of 3, and 0 otherwise. The result is always at least 0.
