Here is the Java equivalent of the provided Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int targetValue = scanner.nextInt();
        int s = scanner.nextInt();
        int q = scanner.nextInt();
        int ans = 0;
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        while (s < targetValue) {
            Future<Integer> future = executorService.submit(() -> calculateProduct(s, q));
            s = future.get();
            ans++;
        }
        executorService.shutdown();
        System.out.println(ans);
    }

    private static int calculateProduct(int s, int q) {
        return s * q;
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads three integers from the standard input, and then it calculates the product of `s` and `q` in a loop until `s` is greater than or equal to `targetValue`. The number of iterations is counted and printed as the result.

Please note that the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module is not included in the Java code because it is not necessary for the problem at hand.
