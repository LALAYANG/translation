Explanation:

The Python code is using the `threading` module to create a thread that calculates the product of `n` and `factor` in parallel. The result is stored in a queue, and the main thread retrieves the result and uses it to calculate the final result.

In Java, we can use the `ThreadLocalRandom` class to generate random numbers in parallel. We can also use the `ExecutorService` class to create a thread pool and submit tasks to be executed in parallel.

In this solution, we create a `ProductCalculator` class that has a `main` method that calculates the product of `n` and `factor` using the `calculateProduct` method. We then use the `ThreadLocalRandom` class to generate random numbers in parallel, and store the result in an array `b`. Finally, we calculate the final result by iterating over the array `b` and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Note that this solution is not exactly equivalent to the Python code, as it does not use threads to calculate the product. However, it should give similar performance and results to the Python code.
