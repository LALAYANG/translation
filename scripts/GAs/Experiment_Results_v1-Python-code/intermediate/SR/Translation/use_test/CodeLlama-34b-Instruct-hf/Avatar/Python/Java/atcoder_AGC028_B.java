public class CalculateValue {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int operandOne = scanner.nextInt();
        int operandTwo = scanner.nextInt();
        int operandThree = scanner.nextInt();
        int result = calculateValue(operandOne, operandTwo, operandThree);
        System.out.println(result);

This Java code defines a `CalculateValue` class with a `main` method that reads three integers from the standard input using a `Scanner` object, and then calls the `calculateValue` method to calculate the result. The `calculateValue` method takes three integers as input and returns the result of the calculation.

The `calculateValue` method is defined as a static method, which means it can be called without creating an instance of the `CalculateValue` class. This is useful for simple programs like this one, where there is no need to create an instance of the class.

The `calculateValue` method uses the `*` operator to perform the multiplication and the `+` operator to perform the addition. The result is returned as an integer.

In the `main` method, the `Scanner` object is used to read the three integers from the standard input. The `nextInt` method is used to read the next integer from the input stream. The integers are then passed as arguments to the `calculateValue` method, and the result is printed to the standard output using the `println` method.

Note that this code assumes that the input integers are separated by spaces. If the input integers are separated by a different delimiter, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
