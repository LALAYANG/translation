Explanation:

The Python code is using the `collections.Counter` class to count the number of even and odd digits in the input string. The `Counter` class is a dictionary-like object that maps keys to counts. In this case, the keys are the digits '0' and '1', and the counts are the number of times each digit appears in the input string.

The Java code is using a `List` to store the input string, and then iterating over the list to count the number of even and odd digits. The `List` class is a collection of objects that can be accessed by index. In this case, the list is a list of `Integer` objects, and the index is used to access the digits in the input string.

The Java code is also using the `Arrays.asList` method to convert the input string to a list of `Integer` objects. This is necessary because the `List` class does not have a constructor that takes a string as an argument.

The Python code is using the `scipy.stats.ttest_ind` function to perform a two-sample t-test on the input list. The t-test is a statistical test that compares the means of two independent samples. In this case, the two samples are the even and odd digits in the input list. The `ttest_ind` function returns a `TTestResult` object, which contains the results of the t-test.

The Java code is not using any statistical libraries, so it does not have a direct equivalent to the `ttest_ind` function. However, it is possible to implement a t-test in Java using the `java.util.stream` package.

The Python code is using the `sklearn.utils.shuffle` function to shuffle the input list. The `shuffle` function returns a shuffled version of the input list.

The Java code is using the `Collections.shuffle` method to shuffle the input list. This method returns a shuffled version of the input list.

The Python code is using the `numpy.min` function to find the minimum value in an array. The `numpy.min` function returns the minimum value in the array.

The Java code is using the `Math.min` method to find the minimum value in an array. This method returns the minimum value in the array.

In summary, the Python code is using the `collections.Counter` class and the `scipy.stats.ttest_ind` function to perform a two-sample t-test on the input list, and the `sklearn.utils.shuffle` function to shuffle the input list. The Java code is using the `List` class and the `Collections.shuffle` method to perform the same operations.
