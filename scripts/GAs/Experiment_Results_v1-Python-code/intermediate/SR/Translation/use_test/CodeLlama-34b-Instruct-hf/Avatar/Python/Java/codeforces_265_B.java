Note: The `ThreadLocalRandom` class is used to generate random numbers in the `calculateDifference` method.

Explanation:

The Python code you provided is a bit complex, so I'll break it down into smaller parts to explain how it works.

1. The first part of the code is the `calculate_difference` function, which takes two arguments: `count_input` and `constant_variable`. It returns the difference between the two arguments.
2. The next part of the code is the `recursive_input` function, which takes three arguments: `i`, `stop`, and `step`. It recursively reads input from the user and stores it in a list called `list_input`.
3. The `calculate_difference_thread` function is a thread that runs the `calculate_difference` function and stores the result in a queue called `queue_difference`.
4. The main thread starts the `calculate_difference_thread` thread and waits for it to finish using the `join` method.
5. The main thread then retrieves the result from the `queue_difference` queue and stores it in a variable called `difference_result`.
6. The main thread then calculates the final result by iterating over the `list_input` list and calculating the absolute difference between each element and the previous element.
7. The final result is printed to the console.

In Java, we can use the `ThreadLocalRandom` class to generate random numbers, which is what the `ttest_ind` function does in the Python code. We can also use the `Queue` class to implement a queue data structure, which is what the `queue_difference` queue does in the Python code.

The Java code I provided is a direct translation of the Python code you provided, with the exception of the `ttest_ind` function, which I replaced with a call to the `ThreadLocalRandom` class. The `calculateDifference` method is the same as the `calculate_difference` function in the Python code, and the `main` method is the same as the main thread in the Python code.
