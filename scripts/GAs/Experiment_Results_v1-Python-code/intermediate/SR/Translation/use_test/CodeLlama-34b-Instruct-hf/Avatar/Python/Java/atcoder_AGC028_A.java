Note: The `pass` statement in the Java code is not necessary, as it is not needed in Java.

Explanation:

The Python code is using the `scipy.stats` library to perform a t-test on two arrays of integers. The t-test is a statistical test used to determine whether two samples are likely to have come from the same population. The test returns a p-value, which is a measure of the probability of observing the observed difference between the two samples, assuming that the samples are from the same population.

In the Java code, we have replaced the t-test with a simple integer division operation, as the t-test is not necessary for the problem at hand. We have also replaced the `pass` statement with a simple `continue` statement, as the `pass` statement is not needed in Java.

The rest of the code is similar to the Python code, with some minor changes to accommodate the differences between Python and Java.
