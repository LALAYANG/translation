Explanation:

The Python code is using a recursive function `recursive_sum` to calculate the sum of two numbers represented as strings. The function takes three arguments: `i` is the index of the current digit, `stop` is the maximum length of the numbers, and `step` is the step size for the recursion.

The function first checks if the current digit is beyond the maximum length of the numbers or if the step size is zero. If so, it returns immediately.

Then it calculates the sum of the current digit of the two numbers and the carry from the previous digit. If the sum is greater than 9, it sets the carry to 1 and adds the sum modulo 10 to the result string. Otherwise, it sets the carry to 0 and adds the sum to the result string.

The function then recursively calls itself with the next digit and the updated carry.

The Java code is similar, but it uses a loop instead of recursion to calculate the sum. It also uses the `Integer.parseInt` method to convert the digits of the numbers to integers, and the `String.valueOf` method to convert the integers back to strings.

The `rjust` and `ljust` methods are used to pad the shorter number with zeros to make it the same length as the longer number.

The `ThreadLocalRandom` class is used to generate a random number for the `c` variable.

The `Queue` class is used to store the result of the `prepend_one` method, which is called in a separate thread. The `Thread` class is used to create a new thread for the `prepend_one` method. The `join` method is used to wait for the thread to finish. The `get` method is used to retrieve the result from the queue.
