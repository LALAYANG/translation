```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int testCaseId = scanner.nextInt();
        solve(testCaseId);
    }

    public static void solve(int testCaseId) {
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        ttest_ind([55, 95, 4], [2, 77, 3]);
        System.out.println(1 if a == 0 else 0);
    }

    public static void ttest_ind(int[] a, int[] b) {
        // Implement the t-test here
    }
}
```
Note: The `ttest_ind` function is not implemented in the above code. You will need to implement it yourself.

Explanation:

The Python code you provided is a Python script that defines a decorator function `my_decorator` and a function `solve` that is decorated with `my_decorator`. The `solve` function takes a single argument `test_case_id` and reads an integer from the standard input using `stdin.readline().strip()`. It then calls the `ttest_ind` function with two integer arrays as arguments. Finally, it prints `1` if the input is `0` and `0` otherwise.

The Java code I provided is a Java class that defines a `main` method that reads an integer from the standard input using `Scanner` and calls the `solve` method with the input as an argument. The `solve` method is defined in the same class and takes an integer argument `testCaseId`. It reads an integer from the standard input using `Scanner` and calls the `ttest_ind` method with two integer arrays as arguments. Finally, it prints `1` if the input is `0` and `0` otherwise.

Note that the `ttest_ind` method is not implemented in the Java code. You will need to implement it yourself.
