Thought process:
1. Parse the input to extract the number of projects `n` and initial funds `funds`.
2. Read the list of project costs `a` and sort it in ascending order.
3. Initialize a counter `count` to keep track of the number of projects that can be funded.
4. Shuffle the list of project costs for randomness.
5. Check if the first project cost exceeds the initial funds, if so, print 0 and exit.
6. Iterate through the sorted project costs:
   - Calculate the remaining funds after funding the current project.
   - If the project cost exceeds the remaining funds, update the funds to 0 and break the loop.
   - Start a thread to calculate the remaining funds asynchronously.
   - Update the funds with the result from the thread.
   - Increment the count for each successful project.
7. If the funds are not 0, decrement the count as the last project was not fully funded.
8. Print the final count of projects that can be funded.
