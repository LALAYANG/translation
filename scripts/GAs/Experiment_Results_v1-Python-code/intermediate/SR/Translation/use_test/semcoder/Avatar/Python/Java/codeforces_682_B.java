Thought process:
1. The code snippet provided is a Python code that performs a t-test on two sets of data and then iterates through a list to find the count of elements greater than a certain value.
2. The code snippet is using various bitwise operations and conditions to determine the behavior of the loop.
3. The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` and then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
4. The loop iterates through the sorted list and increments a counter `c` if the current element is greater than the previous maximum.
5. The final output is the count of elements in the list that are greater than the previous maximum, plus 1.

Translation to Java:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] NewList = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            NewList[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        sc.close();

        int c = 0;
        int CheckerSix = 342;
        int CheckerFive = 241;
        int CheckerThree = 881;
        int CheckerOne = 883;
        int CheckerTwo = 451;
        int CheckerFour = 709;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((CheckerTwo & CheckerFour) != 0 && (CheckerThree & CheckerOne) != 0 && (CheckerSix & CheckerFive) != 0) {
                if (NewList[i] > c) {
                    c++;
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(c + 1);
    }
}
```

This Java code snippet reads input, performs the specified operations, and outputs the result as expected.
