Thought process:
1. The code snippet provided is a mix of Python functions, imports, and calculations.
2. The `sum_two` function is decorated with `my_decorator` and then called with arguments `a=98` and `b=28`.
3. The `ttest_ind` function is called with the arguments `[98, 54, 43]` and `[75, 59, 87]`.
4. The `shuffle` function is called with the argument `[3, 96, 28]`.
5. The input string is converted to a list and then split into even and odd indices.
6. The counts of '0' and '1' in even and odd indices are calculated.
7. The minimum of two values is calculated and printed.

Translation to Java:
1. Define a decorator function `my_decorator` that takes a function `func` as input.
2. Define a wrapper function `dec_result` that calls the original function `func` with the provided arguments.
3. Decorate the `sum_two` function with `my_decorator`.
4. Import necessary libraries: `ttest_ind` from `scipy.stats`, `shuffle` from `sklearn.utils`, `np` from `numpy`, and `collections`.
5. Read the input string, split it into even and odd indices, calculate counts of '0' and '1'.
6. Shuffle the list `[3, 96, 28]`.
7. Calculate the minimum of two values and print the result.

```java
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String inputString = scanner.nextLine();

        int evenCounts = Collections.frequency(List.of(inputString.split("")), "0");
        int oddCounts = Collections.frequency(List.of(inputString.split("")), "1");

        int result = Math.min(inputString.length() - evenCounts, inputString.length() - oddCounts);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```
