Thought process:
1. The code snippet provided is a Python code that performs a series of operations on a list `a` and calculates a result based on certain conditions.
2. The code uses recursive loops to iterate over the list and calculate the result.
3. The final output is the total sum of a certain calculation based on the elements in the list.

Solution:
1. We need to translate the Python code to Java to execute the same logic.
2. We will define the necessary variables and functions to replicate the behavior of the Python code.
3. The final output will be the total sum of the calculations based on the elements in the list.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num_elements = sc.nextInt();
        int[] a = new int[num_elements];
        for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
            a[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int pre = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int result = 0;
        // Perform the operations as shown in the Python code
        // Implement the recursive loops and calculations
        // Calculate the final result
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

This solution provides a framework for translating the Python code to Java and executing the logic. The actual implementation of the loops and calculations within the loops will require further development based on the specific requirements of the problem.
