Thought process:
1. The code uses the `ttest_ind` function from `scipy.stats` to perform a two-sample t-test.
2. It then sets up an adjacency list to represent the tree structure and performs BFS to calculate the child count of each node.
3. It checks for certain conditions and prints 'First' if a specific condition is met, otherwise prints 'Second'.
