Thought process:
1. The code reads multiple integers using `read_multiple_ints()` and stores them in `result_MI0`.
2. It calculates the total number of steps, A, and B based on the input values.
3. It then calculates the current steps based on the total steps, A, and B values.
4. Finally, it prints the current steps.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int totalSteps = scanner.nextInt();
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();

        int currentSteps = 0;
        int rep = totalSteps / (A + B);
        currentSteps += rep * A;
        int res = totalSteps - rep * (A + B);
        currentSteps += Math.min(res, A);

        System.out.println(currentSteps);
    }
}
```
