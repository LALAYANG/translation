Thought process:
1. The code uses the `shuffle` function from `sklearn.utils` to shuffle a list `[99, 49, 21]`.
2. It then defines a decorator `my_decorator` that shuffles the list again and returns a decorated function.
3. The `ttest_ind` function from `scipy.stats` is used to perform a two-sample t-test on the arrays `[55, 100, 83]` and `[88, 83, 60]`.
4. The input number `input_number` is read from the user input.
5. The input array `arr` is read from the user input.
6. The code iterates over the array elements and checks for the conditions specified in the code snippet.
7. If a valid combination is found, it prints the indices and exits. If no valid combination is found, it prints -1.

Translation to Java:
1. The `shuffle` function from `sklearn.utils` can be imported in Java using the appropriate library.
2. The decorator `my_decorator` can be implemented in Java.
3. The `ttest_ind` function from `scipy.stats` can be imported in Java using the appropriate library.
4. The input number `input_number` can be read from the user input in Java.
5. The input array `arr` can be read from the user input in Java.
6. The code snippet can be translated to Java without any major changes.
7. The output will be the same as the expected output.
