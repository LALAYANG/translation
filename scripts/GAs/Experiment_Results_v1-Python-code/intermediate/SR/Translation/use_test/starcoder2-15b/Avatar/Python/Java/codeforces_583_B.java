# Python to Java

This repository contains a collection of Python code snippets and their Java equivalents. The goal is to provide a resource for developers who are interested in learning Java by translating Python code to Java.

## Usage

Each code snippet is provided in both Python and Java. The Python code is provided as-is, while the Java code is translated from Python using the [Jython](https://www.jython.org/) compiler.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have a Python code snippet that you would like to see translated to Java, please submit a pull request.
