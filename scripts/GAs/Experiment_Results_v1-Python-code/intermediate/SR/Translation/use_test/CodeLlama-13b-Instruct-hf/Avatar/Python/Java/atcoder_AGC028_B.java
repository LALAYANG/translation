The provided Python code is using several libraries and techniques that are not commonly used in Java programming. However, I can provide a basic outline of how the code could be translated to Java.

First, the code is using the `threading` library to create a new thread for the `calculate_value` function. In Java, you can use the `Thread` class to create a new thread and run a function in parallel.

Next, the code is using the `queue` library to create a queue for storing the results of the `calculate_value` function. In Java, you can use the `Queue` class to create a queue and add and remove elements from it.

The code is also using the `numpy` library to perform mathematical operations on arrays. In Java, you can use the `Arrays` class to perform similar operations on arrays.

Here is a basic outline of how the code could be translated to Java:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.Thread;
import java.util.concurrent.Queue;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class CalculateValue {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new thread for the calculateValue function
        Thread calculateValueThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                // Calculate the value of the operands
                int operandOne = 7;
                int operandTwo = 10;
                int operandThree = 9;
                int result = calculateValue(operandOne, operandThree, operandTwo);

                // Add the result to the queue
                Queue<Integer> queue = new Queue<>();
                queue.add(result);
            }
        });

        // Start the thread and wait for it to finish
        calculateValueThread.start();
        try {
            calculateValueThread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Get the result from the queue
        int result = queue.poll();

        // Print the result
        System.out.println(result);
    }

    private static int calculateValue(int operandOne, int operandThree, int operandTwo) {
        return (int) Math.pow(operandTwo, operandThree) + operandOne;
    }
}
```
This code creates a new thread for the `calculateValue` function, which calculates the value of the operands and adds the result to a queue. The main thread then waits for the `calculateValue` thread to finish and gets the result from the queue. Finally, the code prints the result.

Note that this is just a basic outline and the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
