The provided Python code is a solution to a problem on a programming contest. It is not a complete program, but rather a set of functions and variables that can be used to solve the problem.

To translate this code to Java, we need to first understand what the code is doing. The code is solving a problem that involves finding the number of ways to express a given number as a product of prime factors. The code uses a threaded approach to solve the problem, with each thread responsible for finding the prime factors of a given number.

Here is a possible Java translation of the code:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class PrimeFactorization {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;
    private static final int THREAD_COUNT = 10;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();
        ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(THREAD_COUNT, THREAD_COUNT, 0, TimeUnit.SECONDS, queue);

        for (int i = 0; i < THREAD_COUNT; i++) {
            executor.submit(new PrimeFactorizationThread(n, queue));
        }

        try {
            executor.shutdown();
            executor.awaitTermination(Long.MAX_VALUE, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        int[] factors = queue.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).toArray();
        int[] factorCounts = new int[factors.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < factors.length; i++) {
            factorCounts[i] = factors[i];
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < factorCounts.length; i++) {
            int x = factorCounts[i];
            for (int j = 1; j < 99999999; j++) {
                if (x >= j) {
                    x -= j;
                    ans += 1;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(ans);
    }

    private static class PrimeFactorizationThread implements Runnable {
        private final int n;
        private final BlockingQueue<Integer> queue;

        public PrimeFactorizationThread(int n, BlockingQueue<Integer> queue) {
            this.n = n;
            this.queue = queue;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            int[] factors = primeFactors(n);
            for (int factor : factors) {
                queue.offer(factor);
            }
        }

        private int[] primeFactors(int n) {
            int[] factors = new int[10];
            int i = 0;
            while (n % 2 == 0) {
                factors[i++] = 2;
                n /= 2;
            }
            for (int f = 3; f * f <= n; f += 2) {
                while (n % f == 0) {
                    factors[i++] = f;
                    n /= f;
                }
            }
            if (n > 1) {
                factors[i++] = n;
            }
            return factors;
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to create a pool of threads, each of which is responsible for finding the prime factors of a given number. The `primeFactors` method is used to find the prime factors of a number, and the `primeFactorizationThread` method is used to create a thread that will find the prime factors of a given number and add them to a queue.

The `main` method creates a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with a fixed number of threads, and submits a `PrimeFactorizationThread` for each number to be factored. The `main` method then waits for all the threads to complete and collects the results from the queue.

Note that this code is not optimized for performance, and it may not be the most efficient way to solve the problem. However, it should give you a good starting point for translating the Python code to Java.
