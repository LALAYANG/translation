The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several features that are not commonly used in Java programming. However, I can provide a basic Java implementation of the algorithm that the code is trying to implement.

Here is a basic Java implementation of the algorithm:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] l = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            l[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int high = 1;
        int tower = n;
        int maximum = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (l[i] == l[i - 1]) {
                tower--;
                high++;
            } else {
                if (high > maximum) {
                    maximum = high;
                }
                high = 1;
            }
        }
        if (high > maximum) {
            maximum = high;
        }
        System.out.println(maximum + " " + tower);
    }
}
```
This implementation reads the input from the user, stores it in an array, and then iterates over the array to find the maximum number of consecutive elements that are equal. It then prints the maximum number and the number of elements in the array.

Note that this implementation is not exactly the same as the Python code, as it does not use the `shuffle` function or the `my_decorator` function. However, it should produce the same output for the given input.
