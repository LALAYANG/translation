The provided Python code is a solution to a problem on a programming contest. It is not a complete program, but rather a set of functions that can be used to solve the problem.

The problem statement is not provided, so I cannot provide a complete Java solution. However, I can provide a high-level overview of the Python code and explain how it can be translated to Java.

The Python code defines several functions, including `read_line()`, `read_int()`, `read_ints_from_line()`, `III()`, `Line()`, `my_sign()`, `I_thread()`, and `recursive_loop()`. These functions are used to read input from the user, perform calculations, and print the output.

The `read_line()` function reads a line of input from the user and returns it as a string. The `read_int()` function reads a single integer from the user and returns it as an integer. The `read_ints_from_line()` function reads a line of input from the user and returns it as a list of integers. The `III()` function reads a line of input from the user and returns it as a list of integers. The `Line()` function reads a line of input from the user and returns it as a list of lists of integers.

The `my_sign()` function takes a single integer as input and returns its sign (i.e., 1 if the integer is positive, -1 if it is negative, and 0 if it is zero). The `I_thread()` function starts a new thread that reads an integer from the user and puts it in a queue. The `recursive_loop()` function is a recursive function that takes three arguments: an index, a stop value, and a step value. It prints the index and the stop value, and then calls itself with the new index and step value.

The Python code uses several libraries, including `threading`, `queue`, `sys`, `math`, and `collections`. These libraries are used to perform multithreading, queueing, and other operations.

To translate this Python code to Java, you will need to use the Java equivalent of the Python libraries and functions. For example, you can use the `java.util.concurrent` package for multithreading, and the `java.util.Queue` class for queueing. You can also use the `java.lang.Math` class for mathematical operations.

Here is an example of how the `read_line()` function could be translated to Java:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ReadLine {
    public static String readLine() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        return scanner.nextLine();
    }
}
```
You can then use this function in your Java code like this:
```
String line = ReadLine.readLine();
```
Similarly, you can translate the other functions in the Python code to Java. For example, the `read_int()` function could be translated to Java like this:
```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ReadInt {
    public static int readInt() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        return scanner.nextInt();
    }
}
```
You can then use this function in your Java code like this:
```
int num = ReadInt.readInt();
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
