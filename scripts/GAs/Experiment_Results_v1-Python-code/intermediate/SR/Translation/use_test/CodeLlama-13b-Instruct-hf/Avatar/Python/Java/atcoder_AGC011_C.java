The provided Python code is a decorator function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph. The decorator function is used to decorate the `dfs` function, which is a recursive function that performs the DFS on the graph.

Here is the Java code that implements the same functionality:
```java
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class DFS {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 100000;
        int m = 59037;
        int[] visited = new int[n + 1];
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
            visited[i] = 0;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int u = (int) (Math.random() * n);
            int v = (int) (Math.random() * n);
            queue.add(u);
            queue.add(v);
        }
        int ci = 0;
        int cb = 0;
        int cc = 0;
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int u = queue.poll();
            if (visited[u] == 0) {
                if (queue.size() == 0) {
                    ci++;
                } else {
                    dfs(u, visited, queue);
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ci * ci + 2 * ci * (n - ci) + cc * cc + 2 * cb * cc + 2 * cb * cb);
    }

    public static void dfs(int u, int[] visited, Queue<Integer> queue) {
        visited[u] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < queue.size(); i++) {
            int v = queue.poll();
            if (visited[v] == 0) {
                visited[v] = 1;
                dfs(v, visited, queue);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
In this Java code, we have defined a `DFS` class that contains the `main` method, which is the entry point of the program. The `main` method takes two arguments: `n` and `m`, which represent the number of nodes and edges in the graph, respectively.

We have also defined a `dfs` method that performs the DFS on the graph. The `dfs` method takes three arguments: `u`, `visited`, and `queue`. The `u` argument represents the current node, the `visited` argument represents the array of visited nodes, and the `queue` argument represents the queue of nodes to be visited.

The `dfs` method first checks if the current node `u` has been visited before. If it has not been visited, it marks it as visited and adds it to the queue of nodes to be visited. Then, it iterates over the neighbors of the current node and recursively calls the `dfs` method on each neighbor that has not been visited before.

Finally, the `main` method initializes the `visited` array and the `queue` of nodes to be visited, and then iterates over the nodes in the graph and calls the `dfs` method on each node. The `dfs` method returns the number of connected components in the graph.

Note that the `dfs` method is not a recursive function, but it uses a recursive approach to perform the DFS on the graph. This is because the `dfs` method is called recursively on each neighbor of the current node, which allows it to explore the graph in a depth-first manner.
