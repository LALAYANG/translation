The provided Python code is using the `scipy.stats` library to perform a t-test on two sets of data. The `ttest_ind` function is used to calculate the t-statistic and p-value for the two sets of data. The code then uses these values to determine whether the two sets of data are significantly different from each other.

To translate this code to Java, you can use the `org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference.TTest` class from the Apache Commons Math library. This class provides a method for performing a t-test on two sets of data, and it returns a `TTestResult` object that contains the t-statistic and p-value.

Here is an example of how you can use the `TTest` class to perform a t-test on two sets of data in Java:
```
import org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference.TTest;
import org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference.TTestResult;

// Define the two sets of data
double[] data1 = {51, 89, 100};
double[] data2 = {9, 74, 43};

// Perform the t-test
TTest ttest = new TTest();
TTestResult result = ttest.tTest(data1, data2);

// Print the t-statistic and p-value
System.out.println("t-statistic: " + result.getTStatistic());
System.out.println("p-value: " + result.getPValue());
```
This code will perform a t-test on the two sets of data and print the t-statistic and p-value to the console.

Note that the `TTest` class also provides methods for performing other types of statistical tests, such as the F-test and the chi-squared test. You can use these methods to perform different types of statistical tests in your Java code.
