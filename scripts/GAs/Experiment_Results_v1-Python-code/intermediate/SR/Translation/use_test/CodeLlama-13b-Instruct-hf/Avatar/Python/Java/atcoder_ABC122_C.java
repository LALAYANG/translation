The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves processing a string of characters and counting the number of occurrences of a specific pattern (in this case, the pattern "AC"). The code uses a decorator function to define a custom function that counts the number of occurrences of the pattern, and then uses the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module to compute the cumulative sum of the counts.

Here is the equivalent Java code for the same problem:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int q = scanner.nextInt();
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        List<List<Integer>> problems = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
            List<Integer> problem = new ArrayList<>();
            problem.add(scanner.nextInt());
            problem.add(scanner.nextInt());
            problems.add(problem);
        }

        int[] cumsum = new int[n];
        cumsum[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            cumsum[i] = cumsum[i - 1] + (s.substring(i - 1, i + 1).equals("AC") ? 1 : 0);
        }

        for (List<Integer> problem : problems) {
            int l = problem.get(0);
            int r = problem.get(1);
            System.out.println(cumsum[r - 1] - cumsum[l - 1]);
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses a similar approach as the Python code, but it uses Java's `String` class and `ArrayList` class to store the input string and the list of problems, respectively. The `cumsum` array is initialized with the value 0 for the first element, and then the remaining elements are computed using the `substring` method to check if the substring "AC" appears at the current position. The `cumsum` array is then used to compute the answer for each problem by subtracting the cumulative sum of the left bound from the cumulative sum of the right bound.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is a single line of text, and that the list of problems is a list of pairs of integers representing the left and right bounds of each problem, respectively. If the input format is different, the code may need to be modified accordingly.
