The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several concepts that are not commonly used in Java programming. However, I will try my best to provide a Java solution that is similar in functionality to the Python code.

Here is the Java code that I came up with:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] inputNumbers = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            inputNumbers[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int constantValue = scanner.nextInt();
        List<Integer> L = new ArrayList<>();
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            Future<Integer> future = executorService.submit(() -> {
                int result = calculateValue(inputNumbers[i], constantValue);
                L.add(result);
                return result;
            });
        }
        executorService.shutdown();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.println(L.get(i));
        }
    }

    private static int calculateValue(int inputNumber, int constantValue) {
        return inputNumber * constantValue;
    }
}
```
This code uses the `ExecutorService` class from the `java.util.concurrent` package to create a thread pool that can execute multiple tasks concurrently. The `submit` method is used to submit a task to the thread pool, and the `Future` class is used to retrieve the result of the task.

The `calculateValue` method is used to calculate the value of each input number, and the `L` list is used to store the results of the calculations.

The `main` method first reads the input numbers from the console and stores them in an array. It then reads the constant value from the console and creates a thread pool with the same number of threads as the number of input numbers.

For each input number, a task is submitted to the thread pool to calculate its value. The `calculateValue` method is used to calculate the value of each input number, and the result is stored in the `L` list.

Finally, the `main` method prints the results of the calculations to the console.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
