The provided Python code is using the `threading` and `queue` modules to perform a calculation in a separate thread. The `calculate_remaining` function is called in a separate thread using the `threading.Thread` class, and the result is stored in a queue using the `queue.Queue` class. The main thread then retrieves the result from the queue and continues with the rest of the calculation.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class CalculateRemaining {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int funds = 100;
        int[] a = {18132779, 412682070, 141309189, 659925274, 104765981, 381531051, 241880367, 836885153, 420034290, 754052121, 178522842, 209531577, 75672253, 28480496, 411621561, 69147266, 929947988, 130046275, 908122596, 52634146, 115025712, 314230633, 64760919, 180806978, 581197296, 830657404, 270167410, 539684751, 822137046, 664454365, 250513018, 777952570, 523871048, 310831022, 324743959, 385204089, 524225360, 619387222, 416796116, 556443908, 256763933, 649106689, 752519331, 778017432, 410001536, 967395870, 963633494, 451228535, 659878768, 116999903, 47};
        int count = 0;

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
            for (int i : a) {
                if (i > funds) {
                    funds = 0;
                    break;
                }
                int result = calculateRemaining(funds, i);
                funds = result;
                count++;
            }
            return count;
        });

        try {
            int result = future.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            System.out.println(result);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private static int calculateRemaining(int funds, int i) {
        return funds - i;
    }
}
```
This code uses the `ExecutorService` and `Future` classes to perform the calculation in a separate thread. The `ExecutorService` class is used to create a single-threaded executor, and the `Future` class is used to retrieve the result of the calculation. The `calculateRemaining` method is called in the separate thread using the `submit` method of the `ExecutorService` class, and the result is stored in a `Future` object. The main thread then retrieves the result from the `Future` object and prints it to the console.

Note that the `ExecutorService` class is used to create a single-threaded executor, which means that only one thread will be used to perform the calculation. If you want to use multiple threads, you can use the `Executors.newFixedThreadPool` method to create a thread pool with a fixed number of threads.
