Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:
```java

Note that this code uses the `ThreadLocalRandom` class from the `java.util.concurrent` package to generate random numbers, and the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class from the `java.util.concurrent` package to create a thread pool. The `ThreadLocalRandom` class is used to generate a random number between 0 and 100, and the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class is used to create a thread pool with a single thread.
