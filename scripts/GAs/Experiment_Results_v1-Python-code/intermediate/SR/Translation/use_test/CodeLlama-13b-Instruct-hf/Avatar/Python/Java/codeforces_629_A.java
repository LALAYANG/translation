The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves calculating the happiness of a person based on the number of chocolates they have in their cake. The code uses a decorator function to calculate the factorial of the number of chocolates in the cake, and then divides the result by 2 to get the happiness.

Here is the Java code that implements the same logic:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CakeHappiness {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int cakeSize = scanner.nextInt();
        String[] cake = new String[cakeSize];
        int happiness = 0;
        int chocCount = 0;
        int nfat = 1;
        int firstCondition = 58;
        int secondCondition = 194;

        for (int i = 0; i < cakeSize; i++) {
            cake[i] = scanner.nextLine();
            for (int j = 0; j < cake[i].length(); j++) {
                if (cake[i].charAt(j) == 'C') {
                    chocCount++;
                }
            }
            if (firstCondition & secondCondition) {
                if (chocCount > 1) {
                    nfat *= chocCount;
                    for (int j = chocCount - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
                        nfat *= j;
                    }
                    happiness += nfat / 2;
                }
            }
            nfat = 1;
            chocCount = 0;
        }

        int posCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < cakeSize; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cakeSize; j++) {
                if (cake[i].charAt(j) == 'C') {
                    chocCount++;
                }
            }
            if (chocCount > 1) {
                for (int j = chocCount - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
                    nfat *= j;
                }
                happiness += nfat / 2;
            }
            nfat = 1;
            chocCount = 0;
        }

        System.out.println(happiness);
    }
}
```
This code uses a similar approach as the Python code, but it is written in Java. It uses a `Scanner` object to read the input from the user, and it uses a `String` array to store the cake data. The code calculates the happiness by iterating over the cake data and counting the number of chocolates in each row and column. It then calculates the factorial of the number of chocolates and divides the result by 2 to get the happiness.

Note that this code assumes that the input data is a square matrix, and it will not work correctly if the input data is not a square matrix. Also, this code does not handle the case where the number of chocolates in a row or column is greater than 10, as the factorial of a number greater than 10 will overflow the maximum value of an integer in Java.
