The provided Python code is a solution to a problem involving a group of people, where each person has a unique ID and a rank. The goal is to calculate the total value of all possible pairs of people that can be formed, taking into account the rank of each person and the fact that people with higher ranks are more valuable.

Here's a Java implementation of the same solution:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] par = new int[n];
        int[] rank = new int[n];
        int[] size = new int[n];
        int[] b = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            par[i] = i;
            rank[i] = 1;
            size[i] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            b[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int c = 0;
        for (int k = n - 1; k >= 0; k--) {
            int l = 1;
            int r = 1;
            if (k > 0 && b[k - 1] > b[k]) {
                l += size[findRoot(k - 1)];
                uniteGroups(k - 1, k);
            }
            if (k + 1 < n && b[k + 1] > b[k]) {
                r += size[findRoot(k + 1)];
                uniteGroups(k + 1, k);
            }
            c += l * r * b[k];
        }
        System.out.println(c);
    }

    private static int findRoot(int x) {
        if (par[x] == x) {
            return x;
        } else {
            return findRoot(par[x]);
        }
    }

    private static void uniteGroups(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = findRoot(x);
        int rootY = findRoot(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                par[rootX] = rootY;
                size[rootY] += size[rootX];
            } else {
                par[rootY] = rootX;
                size[rootX] += size[rootY];
                if (rank[rootX] == rank[rootY]) {
                    rank[rootX] += 1;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This implementation uses a similar approach as the Python code, with a few differences in syntax and data structures. The `findRoot` method is used to find the root of a group, and the `uniteGroups` method is used to merge two groups together. The `par` array is used to store the parent of each group, and the `rank` array is used to store the rank of each group. The `size` array is used to store the size of each group. The `b` array is used to store the value of each person. The `c` variable is used to store the total value of all possible pairs of people that can be formed.

The `main` method first reads in the number of people `n` and initializes the `par`, `rank`, `size`, and `b` arrays. It then loops through each person and calculates the total value of all possible pairs of people that can be formed, taking into account the rank of each person and the fact that people with higher ranks are more valuable. The `c` variable is printed at the end.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input file contains the values of each person, one per line, in the order in which they appear in the input file.
