The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves finding the minimum number of operations required to sort a list of integers. The code uses a divide-and-conquer approach, where it recursively splits the list into smaller sublists and then merges the sublists to form the final sorted list.

Here is the Java code that implements the same approach:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SortList {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        System.out.println(sort(arr));
    }

    private static int sort(int[] arr) {
        if (arr.length == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        int mid = arr.length / 2;
        int left = sort(Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, 0, mid));
        int right = sort(Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, mid, arr.length));
        return left + right + merge(arr, left, right);
    }

    private static int merge(int[] arr, int left, int right) {
        int[] temp = new int[arr.length];
        int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
        while (i < left && j < right) {
            if (arr[i] <= arr[j]) {
                temp[k++] = arr[i++];
            } else {
                temp[k++] = arr[j++];
            }
        }
        while (i < left) {
            temp[k++] = arr[i++];
        }
        while (j < right) {
            temp[k++] = arr[j++];
        }
        System.arraycopy(temp, 0, arr, 0, temp.length);
        return temp.length;
    }
}
```
This code uses the same divide-and-conquer approach as the Python code, but it is implemented in Java. The `sort` method takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to sort the array. The method first checks if the array has only one element, in which case it returns 0. If the array has more than one element, it recursively splits the array into two subarrays and then merges the subarrays using the `merge` method. The `merge` method takes the two subarrays and the number of elements in each subarray as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to merge the subarrays.

The `merge` method first creates a temporary array of the same size as the input array. It then iterates through the two subarrays and compares the elements at the current position in each subarray. If the element in the first subarray is less than or equal to the element in the second subarray, it copies the element from the first subarray to the temporary array. Otherwise, it copies the element from the second subarray to the temporary array. The method continues this process until it reaches the end of one of the subarrays. Finally, it copies the remaining elements from the other subarray to the temporary array and returns the length of the temporary array.

The `sort` method then recursively calls itself on the two subarrays and adds the number of operations required to merge the subarrays to the total number of operations required to sort the array. It returns the total number of operations required to sort the array.

The `main` method takes an array of integers as input and prints the minimum number of operations required to sort the array. It first creates a `Scanner` object to read input from the user. It then reads the number of elements in the array and creates an array of that size. It then calls the `sort` method on the array and prints the result.
