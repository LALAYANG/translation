Here is the Java version of the Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        int k = scanner.nextInt();
        int l = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c != '1') {
                break;
            }
            l++;
        }
        if (l >= k) {
            System.out.println(1);
        } else {
            System.out.println(s.charAt(l));
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that the Python code uses the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module, which is not available in Java. The equivalent functionality in Java would be to use a different library or implement the functionality manually.

Also, the Python code uses the `queue` and `threading` modules to run the `S()` and `I()` functions concurrently. This is not necessary in Java, as Java is single-threaded by default. The `S()` and `I()` functions can be called directly.

The `pf(s)` function is not used in the main function, so it has been removed.

The `main()` function in the Python code is replaced with a `main` method in the Java code. The `S()` and `I()` functions are replaced with `scanner.nextLine()` and `scanner.nextInt()` respectively. The `print` function is replaced with `System.out.println()`.

The `read_int_list()`, `LI_()`, `LF()`, `LS()`, `I()`, `F()`, `S()`, `pf(s)`, `dd`, `ddn`, `inf`, `eps`, `mod` functions are not used in the Java code, so they have been removed.

The `pf(s)` function is not used in the main function, so it has been removed.
