The given Python code is using several libraries such as cryptography, sklearn, and scipy. However, Java does not have direct equivalents for these libraries. Therefore, it is not possible to translate the given Python code to Java.

However, if you want to perform similar operations in Java, you can use the following code snippets:

For cryptography:
```java
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
```

For sklearn:
```java
import weka.clusterers.SimpleKMeans;
import weka.core.Instances;
import weka.core.converters.ConverterUtils.DataSource;
```

For scipy.stats:
```java
import org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference.TTest;
```

Please note that these are not direct equivalents and you may need to adjust your code accordingly.
