        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        if ((checkFirstCondition & checkSubFirstCondition) != 0) {
            if ((checkSecondCondition & checkSubSecondCondition) != 0) {
                if ((checkThirdCondition & checkForthCondition) != 0) {
                    if (age == 1) {

                        int secondInput = scanner.nextInt();
                        System.out.println(a + secondInput);
                    }
