            if (set.size() != expectedListLength) {
                System.out.println("Oh, my keyboard!");
            } else {

Please note that the shuffle function in Java does not work the same way as in Python. In Python, it shuffles the list in-place, but in Java, it returns a new list. Therefore, I used the Collections.shuffle method to shuffle the list.

Also, the pop(0) method in Python is equivalent to remove(0) in Java.

The union operation in Python is equivalent to addAll method in Java.

The discard method in Python is equivalent to remove method in Java.

The & operator in Python is equivalent to the & operator in Java.

The len function in Python is equivalent to the size method in Java.

The print function in Python is equivalent to the System.out.println method in Java.

The if statement in Python is equivalent to the if statement in Java.

The set data structure in Python is equivalent to the HashSet class in Java.

The list data structure in Python is equivalent to the ArrayList class in Java.

The int data type in Python is equivalent to the int data type in Java.

The list data type in Python is equivalent to the ArrayList class in Java.

The set data type in Python is equivalent to the HashSet class in Java.

The input function in Python is equivalent to the Scanner class in Java.

The map function in Python is equivalent to the for-each loop in Java.

The list function in Python is equivalent to the ArrayList constructor in Java.

The set function in Python is equivalent to the HashSet constructor in Java.

The split function in Python is equivalent to the split method in Java.

The int function in Python is equivalent to the Integer.parseInt method in Java.
