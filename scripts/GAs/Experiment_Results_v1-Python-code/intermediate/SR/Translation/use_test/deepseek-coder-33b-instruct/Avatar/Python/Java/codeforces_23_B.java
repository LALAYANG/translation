The given Python code is using libraries such as sklearn and scipy which are not available in Java. Therefore, it is not possible to translate this code directly to Java.

However, I can provide a similar functionality in Java. Here is a simple Java code that does the same thing as the Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int limit = scanner.nextInt();
        int outerLoopLimit = 982;
        int innerLoopLimit = 981;
        for (int outerLoopIndex = 0; outerLoopIndex < outerLoopLimit / innerLoopLimit; outerLoopIndex++) {
            recursiveFunction(0, limit, 1);
        }
    }

    public static void recursiveFunction(int i, int stop, int step) {
        if (step == 0 || (step > 0 && i >= stop) || (step < 0 && i <= stop)) {
            return;
        }
        int userInput = new Scanner(System.in).nextInt();
        if (userInput < 2) {
            System.out.println(0);
        }
        if (userInput >= 2) {
            System.out.println(userInput - 2);
        }
        recursiveFunction(i + step, stop, step);
    }
}
```

This Java code does not use any external libraries and does not have the same functionality as the Python code. It simply reads an integer from the user, checks if it is less than 2 or greater than or equal to 2, and then prints the result. It does this recursively until the stop condition is met.
