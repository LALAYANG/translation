Here is the Java version of the Python code. Note that Java does not have built-in support for decorators, so the decorator is not included in the Java version. Also, Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's scipy library, so the ttest_ind function is not included in the Java version.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();
        int C = scanner.nextInt();
        int D = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = 998244353;
        int[][] d = new int[C + 1][D + 1];
        d[A][B] = 1;
        for (int row = A; row <= C; row++) {
            for (int j = B; j <= D; j++) {
                int curr_row_prev_col_val = d[row][j - 1];
                int prev_row_val = d[row - 1][j];
                int prev_row_prev_col_val = d[row - 1][j - 1];
                int col_idx = 1;
                int row_idx = 1;
                d[row][j] += calculateValue(row_idx, j, m, row, curr_row_prev_col_val, col_idx, prev_row_val, prev_row_prev_col_val);
            }
        }
        System.out.println(d[C][D]);
    }

    public static int calculateValue(int row_idx, int j, int m, int row, int curr_row_prev_col_val, int col_idx, int prev_row_val, int prev_row_prev_col_val) {
        return (curr_row_prev_col_val * row + prev_row_val * j - prev_row_prev_col_val * (row - row_idx) * (j - col_idx)) % m;
    }
}
```

This Java code reads the input from the console, performs the same calculations as the Python code, and prints the result. It uses a 2D array to store the values of the calculation, and a method to perform the calculation.
