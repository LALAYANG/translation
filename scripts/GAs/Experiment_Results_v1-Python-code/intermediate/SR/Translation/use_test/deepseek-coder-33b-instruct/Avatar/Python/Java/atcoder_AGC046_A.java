The provided Python code is using several libraries such as cryptography, datetime, time, sklearn, scipy and math. However, Java does not have built-in support for these libraries. Therefore, it is not possible to directly translate the Python code to Java.

However, the logic of the Python code can be implemented in Java. Here is the equivalent Java code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int userInput = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(calculateGcd(360, gcd(360, userInput)));
    }

    public static int calculateGcd(int a, int b) {
        return a / b;
    }

    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return gcd(b, a % b);
        }
    }

    public static void shuffle(Integer[] array) {
        Collections.shuffle(Arrays.asList(array));
    }
}
```

This Java code does not include the functionality of the Python code that uses the cryptography, time, sklearn, scipy and math libraries. It only includes the logic of the Python code that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
