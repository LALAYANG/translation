This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the standard input, performs some bitwise operations, and prints the result. The bitwise operations are replaced with Java's bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>). The while loop is replaced with a while loop in Java. The print statement is replaced with a System.out.println statement. The boolean variable check is replaced with a boolean variable in Java. The increment operator (++) is replaced with the increment operator (++) in Java. The decrement operator (--) is replaced with the decrement operator (--) in Java. The assignment operator (=) is replaced with the assignment operator (=) in Java. The comparison operator (==) is replaced with the comparison operator (==) in Java. The logical operators (&&, ||, !) are replaced with the logical operators (&&, ||, !) in Java. The ternary operator (?:) is replaced with the ternary operator (?:) in Java.
