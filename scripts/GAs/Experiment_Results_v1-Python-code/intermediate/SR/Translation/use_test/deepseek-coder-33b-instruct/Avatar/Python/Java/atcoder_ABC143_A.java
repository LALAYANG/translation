Please note that the ttest_ind function from scipy.stats is not available in Java. If you need to perform a t-test in Java, you would need to implement it yourself or use a library that provides this functionality.

Also, the input for the ttest_ind function is not provided in the Java code. If you need to use this function, you would need to provide the necessary input.

The bitwise AND operation (&) in Java is used instead of the bitwise AND operation in Python. The result of the bitwise AND operation in Java is a boolean, so we need to use the logical AND operator (&&) to perform the bitwise AND operation.

The input for the ttest_ind function is not provided in the Java code. If you need to use this function, you would need to provide the necessary input.
