Please note that the Java code does not include the t-test function from the scipy.stats library, as there is no direct equivalent in Java. The t-test function is used to perform a statistical test to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other. If you need to perform a t-test in Java, you would need to implement it yourself or find a library that provides this functionality.
