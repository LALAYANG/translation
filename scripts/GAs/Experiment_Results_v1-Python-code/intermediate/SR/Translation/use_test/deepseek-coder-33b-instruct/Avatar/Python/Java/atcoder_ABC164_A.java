The given Python code is a simple program that takes two integers as input, compares them, and prints 'safe' if the first number is less than or equal to the second number, and 'unsafe' otherwise. The program also uses a decorator to perform some operations before the main function is executed.

Unfortunately, Java does not support decorators in the same way as Python. Also, Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's scipy or sklearn libraries. Therefore, it is not possible to translate this Python code directly to Java.

However, here is a simple Java version of the program:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int inputOne = scanner.nextInt();
        int inputTwo = scanner.nextInt();

        if (inputOne <= inputTwo) {
            System.out.println("safe");
        } else {
            System.out.println("unsafe");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java program does the same thing as the Python code: it reads two integers from the user, compares them, and prints 'safe' if the first number is less than or equal to the second number, and 'unsafe' otherwise.
