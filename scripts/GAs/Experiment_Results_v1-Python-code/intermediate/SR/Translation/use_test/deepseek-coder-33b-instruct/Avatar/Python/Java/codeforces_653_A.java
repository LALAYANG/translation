This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer from the standard input, reads a list of integers from the standard input, sorts the list, and then checks if certain conditions are met. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and breaks the loop. If the conditions are not met after checking all elements in the list, it prints 'NO'.

Please note that the bitwise AND operation (&) in Java is different from Python. In Java, the bitwise AND operation returns a value that is a combination of the bits of the two operands. In Python, the bitwise AND operation returns a value that is the result of the bitwise AND operation on the two operands.

Also, the `shuffle` function in Python is not available in Java. Instead, we use `Arrays.sort` to sort the array.

The `ttest_ind` function in Python is not available in Java. Instead, we use `Arrays.sort` to sort the array.

The `list(map(int, input().split()))` in Python is replaced by `int[] l = new int[newItem]; for (int i = 0; i < newItem; i++) { l[i] = scanner.nextInt(); }` in Java.

The `if currentItem + 1 in l and currentItem + 2 in l` in Python is replaced by `if (Arrays.binarySearch(l, currentItem + 1) >= 0 && Arrays.binarySearch(l, currentItem + 2) >= 0)` in Java.

The `break` statement in Python is replaced by `break` in Java.

The `else` statement in Python is replaced by `else` in Java.

The `print('YES')` and `print('NO')` in Python are replaced by `System.out.println("YES")` and `System.out.println("NO")` in Java.
