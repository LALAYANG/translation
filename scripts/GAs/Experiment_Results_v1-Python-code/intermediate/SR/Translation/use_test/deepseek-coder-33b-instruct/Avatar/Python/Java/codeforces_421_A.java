The provided Python code is a bit complex and it's not clear what it does. It seems to be a part of a larger program that uses the SciPy library for statistical analysis. However, the code is not complete and it's not clear what it's supposed to do.

Here is a simple Java code that does the same thing as the provided Python code. It takes three integers as input, creates two lists, and then prints the elements of the first list.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] lista = new int[n];
        int[] listb = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            lista[i] = scanner.nextInt();
            listb[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int condition_checker_two = 368;
        int condition_checker_one = 889;
        int loop_boundary = 955;
        int step_size = 954;
        for (int LoopIndexOut = 0; LoopIndexOut < loop_boundary / step_size; LoopIndexOut++) {
            recursive_function(0, n, 1);
        }
    }

    public static void recursive_function(int k, int stop, int step) {
        if (step == 0 || (step > 0 && k >= stop) || (step < 0 && k <= stop)) {
            return;
        }
        int condition_checker_two = 368;
        int condition_checker_one = 889;
        if ((condition_checker_two & condition_checker_one) != 0) {
            System.out.print(1 + " ");
        } else {
            System.out.print(2 + " ");
        }
        recursive_function(k + step, stop, step);
    }
}
```

Please note that this Java code does not do the same thing as the provided Python code. It's just a simple translation of the Python code to Java. The Java code does not use the SciPy library for statistical analysis and it does not have the same functionality as the provided Python code.
