Thought process:
1. Understand the provided code snippet and the problem it aims to solve.
2. Translate the Python code to Java, ensuring that the logic and functionality are preserved.
3. Handle input/output operations and ensure the code runs without errors.

```java
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        int A = 79;
        int operand_b = 6;
        int multiplier = 2;

        int result = calculateDifference(multiplier, A, operand_b);
        if (result < 0) {
            result = 0;
        }

        System.out.println(result);
    }

    public static int calculateDifference(int multiplier, int A, int operand_b) {
        return A - multiplier * operand_b;
    }
}
```

This solution translates the provided Python code snippet to Java, ensuring that the logic and functionality are preserved. It calculates the difference between two numbers based on a multiplier and handles the condition where the result is less than 0.
