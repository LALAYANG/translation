Thought process:
1. Understand the given code snippet and the problem it aims to solve.
2. Translate the Python code to Java, considering the input/output requirements.
3. Ensure the Java code is correct and runs without errors.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int numRounds = scanner.nextInt();
        int total = 0;
        StringBuilder operations = new StringBuilder();

        for (int x = 0; x < numRounds; x++) {
            int A = scanner.nextInt();
            int G = scanner.nextInt();

            if (total + A <= 500) {
                total += A;
                operations.append('A');
            } else {
                total -= G;
                operations.append('G');
            }
        }

        System.out.println(operations.toString());
    }
}
```

This Java code snippet reads the number of rounds from input, processes the rounds according to the conditions specified, and outputs the sequence of operations ('A' for addition and 'G' for subtraction) based on the total value and input values.
