Thought process:
1. Understand the provided code snippet and the function `parity_of_nCr`.
2. Implement the missing functions and classes to make the code runnable.
3. Execute the code with the given input to obtain the expected output.

```java
// Implement the missing functions and classes to make the code runnable

// Define the missing functions and classes here

// Execute the code with the given input to obtain the expected output
```

```python
# Placeholder for the solution
```
