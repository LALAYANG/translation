Thought process:
1. The code snippet provided is a mix of Python functions, import statements, and a while loop with conditions.
2. The `difference` function is decorated with `my_decorator`, which doesn't change the behavior of the function.
3. The `ttest_ind` function from `scipy.stats` is called with two sample lists.
4. The `shuffle` function from `sklearn.utils` is called with a list.
5. The `input` function is used to take user input for `n` and `target_cell`.
6. The while loop iterates until the `current_cell` reaches or exceeds the `target_cell`.
7. Inside the loop, the `current_cell` is updated based on the value at index `difference(current_cell, 1)` in the `s` list.
8. If both `checker_17` and `checker_27` are true, and the `current_cell` equals the `target_cell`, 'YES' is printed and the program exits.
9. If the conditions are not met, 'NO' is printed and the program exits.

Translation to Java:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int targetCell = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] s = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            s[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int currentCell = 0;
        while (currentCell <= targetCell) {
            int checker17 = 367;
            int checker27 = 380;
            currentCell += s[Math.abs(currentCell - 1)];
            if ((checker17 & checker27) != 0) {
                if (currentCell == targetCell) {
                    System.out.println("YES");
                    System.exit(0);
                } else {
                    continue;
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println("NO");
    }
}
```
