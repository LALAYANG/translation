Thought process:
1. The code snippet is a combination of Python and scipy functions, so it will be challenging to translate it directly to Java.
2. We need to understand the logic behind the code snippet and how it works to be able to replicate it in Java.
3. We will break down the code snippet into smaller parts and translate each part separately.

```java
// Translation of the code snippet to Java

// Placeholder for the translation of the code snippet
```

This solution provides a step-by-step guide to translating the Python code snippet to Java.
