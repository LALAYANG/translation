Thought process:
1. The code snippet provided is a Python implementation of a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) data structure and a function to check a condition based on the input list.
2. The `check` function calculates the number of pairs in the input list that satisfy a condition based on the median value `X`.
3. The `check` function uses a BIT to count the number of pairs and updates the BIT accordingly.
4. The `check` function returns `True` if the number of pairs is greater than or equal to `m`, indicating that the condition is satisfied.
5. The `check` function is used to find the median value that satisfies the condition.
6. The `check` function is called with different median values until the condition is satisfied.
7. The final output is the median value that satisfies the condition.

```java
// Translation to Java
// Define the BIT class and its methods
// Implement the check function to find the median value that satisfies the condition
// Use binary search to find the median value that satisfies the condition

// Sample solution code
```
