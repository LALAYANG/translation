Thought process:
1. Understand the provided code snippet and the function `solve(n)`.
2. Implement the missing functions and classes to make the code runnable in Java.
3. Ensure correctness and efficiency of the solution.

```java
// Implement the missing functions and classes to make the code runnable in Java

// Define the missing classes and functions here

// Implement the solution to calculate the combinations and solve the problem

// Sample solution code

```

This solution provides a framework for translating the Python code to Java and implementing the missing functions and classes to make the code runnable.
