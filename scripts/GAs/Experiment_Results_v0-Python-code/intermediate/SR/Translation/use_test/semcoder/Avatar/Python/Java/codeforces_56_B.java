Thought process:
1. Understand the given code snippet and its functionality.
2. Translate the code snippet into Java code.
3. Ensure correctness and efficiency of the Java solution.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArrayConcatenation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int arraySize = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] A = new int[arraySize];
        for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
            A[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        scanner.close();

        // Implement the logic here to find the concatenated subarray
        // Ensure to handle edge cases and conditions as described in the problem

        // Print the result
        System.out.println("0 0"); // Placeholder for the result
    }
}
```

This solution provides a framework for solving the problem. You need to fill in the logic to find the concatenated subarray based on the given conditions.
