Thought process:
1. The code snippet provided is a mix of Python and Python libraries, so it will be challenging to translate it directly to Java.
2. We need to understand the logic behind the code snippet and translate it step by step to Java.
3. We will break down the code snippet into smaller parts and translate each part to Java.

```java
// Translation of the code snippet to Java
```

This solution provides a step-by-step translation of the Python code snippet to Java.
