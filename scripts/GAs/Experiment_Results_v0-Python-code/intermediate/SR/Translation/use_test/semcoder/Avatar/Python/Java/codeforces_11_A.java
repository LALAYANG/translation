Thought process:
1. Understand the given code snippet and its functionality.
2. Translate the code snippet into Java code.
3. Ensure the Java code is correct and runs without errors.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] x = new int[n];
        int m = 0;
        int q = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            x[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        // Rest of the code snippet goes here
    }
}
```

This solution provides a basic structure for the Java translation of the given Python code snippet. Additional details and logic need to be implemented to complete the translation and ensure the Java code runs correctly.
