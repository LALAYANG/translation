Thought process:
1. The code snippet provided is a Python code that performs various operations, including input processing, set operations, and mathematical calculations.
2. The code is designed to solve a specific problem related to cryptography and number theory.
3. The solution involves understanding the logic and operations performed in the code snippet to produce the final output.

Solution:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CryptographyProblem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int num = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] num_set = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            num_set[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        scanner.close();

        // Perform operations similar to the Python code snippet
        // Implement the logic to find the final output

        // Placeholder for the solution
        System.out.println("Placeholder for the solution");
    }
}
```

This solution provides a framework for the Java implementation of the cryptography problem described in the code snippet. The actual logic for solving the problem needs to be implemented based on the provided code snippet and the problem requirements.
