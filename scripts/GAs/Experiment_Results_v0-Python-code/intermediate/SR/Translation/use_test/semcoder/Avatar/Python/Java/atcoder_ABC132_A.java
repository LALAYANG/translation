Thought process:
1. The code snippet provided is a mix of Python and non-Python code, so it will be challenging to translate it directly.
2. We need to understand the code snippet and its functionality to be able to translate it accurately.
3. We will break down the code snippet into individual parts and translate each part separately.

```java
// Translation of the code snippet will follow the structure of the original Python code
```
