Thought process:
1. Parse the input to extract necessary information such as number of people, number of connections, health points of each person, and the connections between people.
2. Implement the logic to check if a person's health point is less than or equal to the health point of their neighbor.
3. Count the number of pairs of people who meet the condition.
4. Print the final count.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int m = sc.nextInt();
        int[] health = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            health[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int[][] path = new int[n][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int a = sc.nextInt() - 1;
            int b = sc.nextInt() - 1;
            path[a][b] = 1;
            path[b][a] = 1;
        }
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (path[i][j] == 1) {
                    if (health[i] <= health[j]) {
                        c++;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
```
