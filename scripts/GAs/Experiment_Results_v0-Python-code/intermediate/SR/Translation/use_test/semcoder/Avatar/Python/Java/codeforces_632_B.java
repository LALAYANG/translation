Thought process:
1. The code snippet provided is a mix of Python and scipy functions, so it will be challenging to translate it directly to Java.
2. We need to understand the logic behind the code snippet to be able to replicate it in Java.
3. We will break down the code snippet into smaller parts and translate each part separately.

```java
// Placeholder for the translated code snippet
```

This solution provides a framework for translating the given Python code snippet to Java. Further implementation and testing are required to ensure correctness and functionality.
