Please note that the Java code provided above is a direct translation of the Python code. It does not include the cryptography and dateutil libraries, which are not available in Java. Also, the Apache Commons Math library is used for the ttest_ind function.

The Java code does not include the base64.b64encode function from the Python code, as it is not necessary for the provided problem. The Python code also uses the http.client library for HTTP connections, which is not available in Java.

The Java code does not include the dateutil.parser.parse function, as Java does not have a direct equivalent. Instead, Java uses the java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter class to parse dates.

The Java code does not include the cryptography.fernet.Fernet class, as Java does not have a direct equivalent. Instead, Java uses the javax.crypto package for cryptographic operations.

The Java code does not include the scipy.stats.ttest_ind function, as Java does not have a direct equivalent. Instead, Java uses the Apache Commons Math library for statistical operations.

The Java code does not include the Fernet.generate_key function, as Java does not have a direct equivalent. Instead, Java uses the javax.crypto.KeyGenerator class to generate cryptographic keys.

The Java code does not include the http.client.HTTPConnection function, as Java does not have a direct equivalent. Instead, Java uses the java.net.HttpURLConnection class for HTTP connections.

The Java code does not include the sklearn.utils.shuffle function, as Java does not have a direct equivalent. Instead, Java uses the java.util.Collections.shuffle method to shuffle a list.
