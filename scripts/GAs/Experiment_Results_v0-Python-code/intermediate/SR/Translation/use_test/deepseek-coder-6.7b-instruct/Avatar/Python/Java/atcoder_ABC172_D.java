This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer from the standard input, calculates a sum of numbers, and prints the result. The calculation is done in a separate thread, which is started by `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1)`. The result of the calculation is stored in a `Future` object, which is retrieved with `future.get()`. The calculation itself is a bit complex, but it's essentially a sum of arithmetic series.
