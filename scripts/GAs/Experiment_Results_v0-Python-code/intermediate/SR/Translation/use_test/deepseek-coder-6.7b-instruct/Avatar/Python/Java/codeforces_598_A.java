Please note that the Python code you provided uses some libraries (like scipy, sklearn, and threading) that do not have direct equivalents in Java. Therefore, the Java code provided does not include these libraries.

Also, the Python code you provided uses a decorator, but it does not seem to be doing anything useful. The decorator is not used in the final result calculation, so it was removed from the Java code.

The Java code uses the ExecutorService class to create a new thread and Future to get the result from the thread. The computeResult method is called in the new thread and its result is stored in the Future. The get method of the Future is then used to get the result from the thread.

The shuffle method from the sklearn library was removed because it does not have a direct equivalent in Java.

The ttest_ind method from the scipy library was removed because it does not have a direct equivalent in Java.
