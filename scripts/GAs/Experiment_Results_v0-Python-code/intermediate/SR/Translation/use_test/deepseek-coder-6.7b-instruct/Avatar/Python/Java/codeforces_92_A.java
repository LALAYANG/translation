Please note that the Java version of the code is not equivalent to the Python version. The Python version uses multithreading and queues, while the Java version uses ExecutorService. Also, the Python version uses the `@` symbol to decorate the `calculate_result` function, which is not available in Java. Therefore, the Java version does not have a decorator.

The Java version also uses the `Future` interface to get the result of the `calculateResult` method, which is not available in the Python version.

The Java version also uses the `LinkedList` class to create a queue, which is not available in the Python version.

The Java version also uses the `Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()` method to create a new ExecutorService, which is not available in the Python version.

The Java version also uses the `shutdown()` method to shut down the ExecutorService, which is not available in the Python version.

The Java version also uses the `get()` method to get the result of the `calculateResult` method, which is not available in the Python version.

The Java version also uses the `LinkedList` class to create a queue, which is not available in the Python version.

The Java version also uses the `submit()` method to submit the `calculateResult` method to the ExecutorService, which is not available in the Python version.

The Java version also uses the `remove()` method to remove an element from the queue, which is not available in the Python version.
