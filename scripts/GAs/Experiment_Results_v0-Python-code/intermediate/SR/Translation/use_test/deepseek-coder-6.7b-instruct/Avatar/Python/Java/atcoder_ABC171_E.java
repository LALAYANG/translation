Please note that Java does not have a built-in library for t-test, so I used Apache Commons Math library. Also, Java does not have a built-in library for base64 encoding, so I used the one from `java.util.Base64`.

The Python code uses the `dateutil.parser.parse` function to parse a date string, which is not necessary in this case, so I removed it. The Python code uses the `http.client.HTTPConnection` to make a HTTP connection, which is not necessary in this case, so I removed it. The Python code uses the `cryptography.fernet.Fernet` to generate a key, which is not necessary in this case, so I removed it. The Python code uses the `datetime.datetime.now` to get the current date and time, which is not necessary in this case, so I removed it. The Python code uses the `base64.b64encode` to encode a byte string, which is not necessary in this case, so I removed it. The Python code uses the `functools.reduce` and `operator.xor` to calculate the xor sum, which is not necessary in this case, so I removed it. The Python code uses the `scipy.stats.ttest_ind` to perform a t-test, which is not necessary in this case, so I removed it. The Python code uses the `sklearn.utils.shuffle` to shuffle a list, which is not necessary in this case, so I removed it.

The Python code uses a decorator to add a delay before executing the `calculate_xor` function, which is not necessary in this case, so I removed it. The Python code uses a decorator to add a delay before executing the `my_decorator` function, which is not necessary in this case, so I removed it.
