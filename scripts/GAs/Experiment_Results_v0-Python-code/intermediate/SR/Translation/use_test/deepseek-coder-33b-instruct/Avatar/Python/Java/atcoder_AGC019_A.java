The provided Python code is a complex script that uses several advanced Python features such as threading, queue, numpy, scipy, and math. It calculates the minimum cost of a certain product based on the quantity of the product and the cost of each product.

Unfortunately, Java does not have built-in support for these features. Therefore, it is not possible to directly translate this Python code to Java.

However, we can provide a simplified version of the code in Java. Here is a simplified version of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int q = scanner.nextInt();
        int h = scanner.nextInt();
        int s = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        int n = scanner.nextInt();

        int best1L = Math.min(Math.min(q * 4, h * 2), s);
        int best2L = Math.min(d, best1L * 2);

        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println((long)best2L * (n / 2));
        } else {
            System.out.println((long)best2L * (n / 2) + best1L);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads the input, calculates the minimum cost, and prints the result. It does not use any advanced features of Python such as threading, queue, numpy, scipy, and math.
