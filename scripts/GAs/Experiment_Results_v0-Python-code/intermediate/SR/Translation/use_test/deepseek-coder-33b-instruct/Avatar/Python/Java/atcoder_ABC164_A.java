The provided Python code is quite complex and uses several libraries that don't have direct equivalents in Java. However, I can provide a simplified version of the code that does not use any external libraries.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int threshold_s = scanner.nextInt();
        int threshold_w = scanner.nextInt();

        if (threshold_s <= threshold_w) {
            System.out.println("safe");
        } else {
            System.out.println("unsafe");
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code reads two integers from the standard input, compares them, and prints "safe" if the first number is less than or equal to the second, and "unsafe" otherwise.

Please note that this is a very simplified version of the original Python code. The original code uses several libraries that don't have direct equivalents in Java, such as `dateutil.parser`, `http.client`, `cryptography.fernet`, `sklearn.utils`, and `scipy.stats`. These libraries are used for various tasks such as parsing dates, making HTTP requests, encryption, data shuffling, and statistical analysis, respectively. These tasks are not possible to replicate in Java without using additional libraries or writing a lot of custom code.
