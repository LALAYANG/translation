The provided Python code is quite complex and involves several libraries and functionalities that are not available in Java. Therefore, it is not possible to translate the entire code into Java. However, I can provide a Java equivalent for the part of the code that calculates the angle difference and prints the result.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int h = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();

        double C = Math.abs(360.0 / 60 * m - 360.0 / 12 * h - 360.0 / 12 / 60 * m);
        if (C > 180) {
            double variable_1_17 = 360;
            C = calculateAngleDifference(variable_1_17, C);
        }
        double cosineOfC = Math.cos(Math.toRadians(C));
        System.out.println(Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b - 2 * a * b * cosineOfC));
    }

    public static double calculateAngleDifference(double variable_1_17, double C) {
        return variable_1_17 - C;
    }
}
```

This Java code reads the input from the user, calculates the angle difference, and prints the result. It uses the `Math` class for mathematical operations and the `Scanner` class for reading the input. The `calculateAngleDifference` method is a simple method that calculates the difference between two angles.
