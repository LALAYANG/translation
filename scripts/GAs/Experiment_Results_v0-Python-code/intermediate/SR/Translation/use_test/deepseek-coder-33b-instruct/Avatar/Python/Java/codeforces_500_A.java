Please note that Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's decorators. Also, Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `input()` function. Instead, we use `Scanner` to read input from the console.

The `shuffle` function from `sklearn.utils` and `ttest_ind` function from `scipy.stats` are not available in Java. If you need to use these functions, you may need to find a Java library that provides similar functionality.

The `sys.exit()` function in Python is equivalent to `System.exit(0)` in Java. It terminates the program with a status code of 0, indicating that the program has completed successfully.

The `&` operator in Python is equivalent to `&` in Java. It performs a bitwise AND operation.

The `continue` statement in Python is equivalent to `continue` in Java. It skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration.

The `print` function in Python is equivalent to `System.out.println` in Java. It prints the specified string to the console.

The `list` function in Python is equivalent to `new` in Java when creating an array. It creates a new array with the specified size.

The `map` function in Python is equivalent to `split` in Java. It splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter.

The `int` function in Python is equivalent to `Integer.parseInt` in Java. It converts a string to an integer.

The `input` function in Python is equivalent to `nextInt` in Java. It reads an integer from the console.

The `difference` function in Python is equivalent to a static method in Java. It calculates the difference between two numbers.
