```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int value1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int z = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println((value1 / z + 1) * z);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the standard input, performs integer division and then multiplies the result by z. The result is printed to the standard output.
