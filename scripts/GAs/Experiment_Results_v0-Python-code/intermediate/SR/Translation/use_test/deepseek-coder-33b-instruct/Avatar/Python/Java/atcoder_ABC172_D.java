Here is the Java equivalent of the provided Python code. Note that Java does not have a direct equivalent to Python's threading module, so the code is simplified to remove the threading part.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        long ans = 0;
        int outer_loop_limit = 670;
        int inner_loop_limit = 669;
        for (int LoopIndexOut = 0; LoopIndexOut < outer_loop_limit / inner_loop_limit; LoopIndexOut++) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
                ans += i * (N / i) * (N / i + 1) / 2;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

This Java code reads an integer from the standard input, performs some calculations, and prints the result. The calculations are equivalent to the Python code, but the threading part is removed because Java does not have a direct equivalent.
