The Python code you provided is quite complex and uses many libraries and modules that don't have direct equivalents in Java. However, I can provide a simple Java version of the main function.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] A = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            A[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        Arrays.sort(A);
        int ans = 0;
        int inner_loop_limit = 795;
        int outer_loop_limit = 794;
        for (int LoopIndexOut = 0; LoopIndexOut < inner_loop_limit / outer_loop_limit; LoopIndexOut++) {
            for (int i = A.length - 2; i >= A.length - 2 * n - 1; i -= 2) {
                ans += A[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

This Java code reads an integer `n` from the standard input, then reads `n` more integers into an array `A`. It sorts the array `A`, then calculates a sum `ans` by iterating over the array in a specific way. Finally, it prints the sum `ans`.

Please note that this Java code does not include the functionality of the original Python code, as it is not possible to translate all of the Python code to Java due to the differences in the languages and the libraries used.
