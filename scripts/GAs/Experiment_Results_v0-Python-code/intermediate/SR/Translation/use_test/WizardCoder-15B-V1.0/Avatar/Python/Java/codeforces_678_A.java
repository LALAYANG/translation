```java
import org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference.TTest;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] sample1 = {20, 77, 81};
        int[] sample2 = {24, 12, 5};
        TTest tTest = new TTest();
        double pValue = tTest.tTest(sample1, sample2);
        if (pValue < 0.05) {
            System.out.println("There is a significant difference between the two samples.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("There is no significant difference between the two samples.");
        }
        int value1 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int value2 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
        int z = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);
        int result = (value1 / z + 1) * z;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

- We first import the TTest class from the org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference package.
- We create two arrays, sample1 and sample2, to represent the two samples we want to compare.
- We create a new instance of the TTest class and call the tTest method to calculate the p-value of the two samples.
- If the p-value is less than 0.05, we print that there is a significant difference between the two samples. Otherwise, we print that there is no significant difference between the two samples.
- We parse the input values from the command line and calculate the result as described in the Python code.
- We print the result.
