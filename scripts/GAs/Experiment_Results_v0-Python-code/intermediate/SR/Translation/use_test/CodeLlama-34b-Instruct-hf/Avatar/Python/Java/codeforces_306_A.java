Here's the Java code that implements the same functionality as the Python code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();

        int q = n / m;
        int remainder = n % m;
        int[] a = new int[m];
        Arrays.fill(a, q);

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            a[i] += 1;
        }

        System.out.println(a);
    }
}
```
Note that the Java code does not include the same level of complexity as the Python code, as it does not use any external libraries or perform any cryptographic operations. The Java code simply performs the integer division and modulus operations and prints the resulting array.
