    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        String s = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            s += "abcd".charAt(i % 4);
        }
        System.out.println(s);

}
```
Explanation:

The Python code is using the modulo operator to get the remainder of `i` divided by 4, and then using that remainder to index into the string "abcd". The Java code does the same thing, but using the `charAt` method to get the character at the specified index.

The Python code also uses a decorator to add some extra functionality to the `recursive_loop` function. The decorator is not necessary in Java, so I removed it and just called the `recursive_loop` function directly.

The Python code also uses the `datetime` and `sklearn` libraries, but these are not necessary in Java, so I removed them.

The Python code also uses the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` library, but this is not necessary in Java, so I removed it.

The Java code is a direct translation of the Python code, but it is not idiomatic Java. In Java, it is more common to use a `for` loop to iterate over a range of numbers, rather than using a recursive function.
