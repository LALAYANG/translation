This Java code takes in a 2D array of integers as input, and outputs the sum of each element in the array with its corresponding element in the transposed array. The output is a 2D array of integers.

For example, if the input is:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```
The output will be:
```
10 12 14
16 18 20
22 24 26
```
Explanation:

* The first element in the input array is 1, and its corresponding element in the transposed array is 4. The sum of these two elements is 10.
* The second element in the input array is 2, and its corresponding element in the transposed array is 5. The sum of these two elements is 12.
* The third element in the input array is 3, and its corresponding element in the transposed array is 6. The sum of these two elements is 14.
* The fourth element in the input array is 4, and its corresponding element in the transposed array is 7. The sum of these two elements is 16.
* The fifth element in the input array is 5, and its corresponding element in the transposed array is 8. The sum of these two elements is 18.
* The sixth element in the input array is 6, and its corresponding element in the transposed array is 9. The sum of these two elements is 20.
* The seventh element in the input array is 7, and its corresponding element in the transposed array is 10. The sum of these two elements is 22.
* The eighth element in the input array is 8, and its corresponding element in the transposed array is 11. The sum of these two elements is 24.
* The ninth element in the input array is 9, and its corresponding element in the transposed array is 12. The sum of these two elements is 26.

Note that the output is a 2D array of integers, where each row represents a row in the input array, and each column represents a column in the input array. The elements in each row are separated by a space.
