This Java code is a direct translation of the Python code you provided. It uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user and the `System.out.println()` method to print output. The code is structured similarly to the Python code, with a `main()` method that contains the main logic of the program.

The `Solution` class is not used in this code, but it is included as a placeholder for any additional methods that may be needed in the future.

Note that this code assumes that the input is a list of integers, and it will not work correctly if the input is in any other format. Additionally, this code does not perform any error checking on the input, so it will not handle invalid input gracefully.
