Note: The `pow` function is a built-in function in Java, but it is not used in this code because it is not necessary.

Explanation:

The code is a Java implementation of the Python code you provided. It uses the same logic and algorithms as the Python code, but it is written in Java.

The `main` method takes an array of integers `c` and an integer `n` as input, and it calculates the power sum of `c` using the `powerSum` method. The `powerSum` method calculates the sum of the elements of `c` and returns it as the modulo of the sum.

The `pow` method is a Java implementation of the `pow` function in Python. It takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `mod` as input, and it calculates the value of `a` raised to the power of `b` modulo `mod`.

The `main` method then calculates the final answer using the `ans` variable, which is the sum of the elements of `c` multiplied by the appropriate power of 2.

The code is written in a modular and object-oriented way, with each method performing a specific task. The `main` method is the entry point of the program, and it calls the other methods to perform the necessary calculations.
