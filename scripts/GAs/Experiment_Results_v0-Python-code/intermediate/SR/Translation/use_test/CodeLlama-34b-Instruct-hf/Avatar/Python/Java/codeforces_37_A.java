Note: The `ThreadLocalRandom` class is used to generate random numbers in the `decrement` and `increment` methods.

Explanation:

The code is similar to the Python code, but it uses Java's concurrency features to implement the `increment` and `decrement` methods. The `increment` method uses a `Queue` to store the result of the increment operation, and the `decrement` method uses a `Queue` to store the result of the decrement operation. The `Thread` class is used to create a new thread for each increment and decrement operation. The `join` method is used to wait for the thread to complete before continuing with the next operation.

The `maximum` variable is used to keep track of the maximum value of `high` during the execution of the program. The `tower` variable is used to keep track of the current value of `tower`.

The `process_list` method is not used in the Java implementation, as it is not necessary to implement the program in a concurrent manner. Instead, the `main` method is used to execute the program sequentially.
