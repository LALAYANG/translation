This code defines a `SumCalculator` class with a `main` method that reads an integer `n` from the user and calculates the sum of the first `n` positive integers using the `calculateSum` method. The `calculateSum` method takes two integer arguments `n` and `m`, and returns the sum of the first `n` positive integers.

The code also includes several imports for various classes and methods that are used in the program, such as `Scanner` for reading input from the user, `Date` for working with dates and times, `Base64` for encoding and decoding data in Base64 format, `Random` for generating random numbers, `List` and `ArrayList` for working with lists, `Collections` for working with collections, `Iterator` for iterating over collections, and `stream` for working with streams.

Note that the code does not include any decorators or other advanced features, as it is intended to be a simple example of how to calculate the sum of the first `n` positive integers in Java.
