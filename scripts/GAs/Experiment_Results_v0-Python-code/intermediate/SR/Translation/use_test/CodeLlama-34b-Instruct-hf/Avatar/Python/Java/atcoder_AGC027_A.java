Explanation:

The Python code you provided is a simple program that calculates the difference between two numbers and prints the result. The program uses the `calculate_difference` function to calculate the difference between the current value and the target value `x`. The function takes two arguments: `current_value` and `x`.

In the Java code, I have translated the Python code to Java. I have used the `ThreadLocalRandom` class to generate random numbers, as the Python code uses the `random` module. I have also used the `System.out.println` method to print the result, as the Python code uses the `print` function.

The Java code is similar to the Python code, but it uses the `calculateDifference` method to calculate the difference between the current value and the target value `x`. The method takes two arguments: `currentValue` and `x`.

The Java code also uses a `for` loop to iterate over the array of numbers and calculate the difference between each number and the target value `x`. The loop starts at the first index of the array and ends at the last index.

If the current value is greater than the target value `x`, the loop breaks and the program prints the result. Otherwise, the loop continues and the program calculates the difference between the current value and the target value `x`.

The Java code also uses a `if` statement to check if the current value is greater than the target value `x`. If it is, the program prints the result and exits. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Overall, the Java code is a direct translation of the Python code, but it uses Java syntax and methods to perform the same operations.
