The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves finding the number of occurrences of a specific pattern in a string. The code uses a decorator function to count the number of occurrences of the pattern, and then uses the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module to perform a two-sample t-test on the counts.

Here is the Java code that implements the same logic:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int numQueries = scanner.nextInt();
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        List<List<Integer>> queries = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numQueries; i++) {
            List<Integer> query = new ArrayList<>();
            query.add(scanner.nextInt());
            query.add(scanner.nextInt());
            queries.add(query);
        }

        int[] cumsum = new int[n];
        cumsum[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            cumsum[i] = cumsum[i - 1] + (s.substring(i - 1, i + 1).equals("AC") ? 1 : 0);
        }

        int limit = 370;
        int divisor = 369;

        for (int i = 0; i < limit / divisor; i++) {
            for (List<Integer> query : queries) {
                int l = query.get(0);
                int r = query.get(1);
                System.out.println(cumsum[r - 1] - cumsum[l - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses a similar approach to the Python code, but it is written in Java. It first reads the input from the user, which consists of the length of the string `n`, the number of queries `numQueries`, and the string `s`. It then creates a list of queries, where each query is a list of two integers representing the left and right indices of the substring to be searched.

The code then computes the cumulative sum of the string `s`, where the cumulative sum is the number of occurrences of the pattern "AC" in the substring `s[0..i]`. It then computes the limit and divisor values, which are used to determine the number of iterations of the outer loop.

In the outer loop, the code iterates over the queries and prints the number of occurrences of the pattern "AC" in the substring `s[l..r]`. The code uses the `substring` method to extract the substring `s[l..r]`, and then uses the `equals` method to check if the substring is equal to "AC". If the substring is equal to "AC", the code increments the count by 1.

Finally, the code prints the count for each query.

Note that the code uses the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module to perform a two-sample t-test on the counts. However, since this function is not available in Java, the code does not use it.
