The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves processing a sequence of queries and maintaining a set of values in a heap. The code uses the `heapq` module from the Python standard library to implement the heap data structure.

Here is a Java implementation of the same logic:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int q = scanner.nextInt();
        int[][] queries = new int[q][3];
        for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
            queries[i] = new int[] { scanner.nextInt(), scanner.nextInt(), scanner.nextInt() };
        }

        PriorityQueue<Integer> p1 = new PriorityQueue<>();
        PriorityQueue<Integer> p2 = new PriorityQueue<>();
        int sum_adjustment = 0;
        int sum_p1 = 0;
        int sum_p2 = 0;

        for (int[] query : queries) {
            if (query[0] == 2) {
                if (p1.size() == p2.size()) {
                    System.out.println(-p2.peek() + " " + (sum_p1 - p1.size() * -p2.peek() + p2.size() * -p2.peek() - sum_p2 + sum_adjustment));
                } else {
                    System.out.println(p1.peek() + " " + (sum_p1 - p1.size() * p1.peek() + p2.size() * p1.peek() - sum_p2 + sum_adjustment));
                }
            } else {
                sum_adjustment += query[2];
                if (p1.isEmpty()) {
                    p1.add(query[1]);
                    sum_p1 += query[1];
                } else if (p1.peek() <= query[1]) {
                    p1.add(query[1]);
                    sum_p1 += query[1];
                } else {
                    p2.add(-query[1]);
                    sum_p2 += query[1];
                }
                if (p1.size() < p2.size()) {
                    int k = p2.poll();
                    p1.add(-k);
                    sum_p2 += k;
                    sum_p1 -= k;
                }
                if (p1.size() - 1 > p2.size()) {
                    int k = p1.poll();
                    p2.add(-k);
                    sum_p1 -= k;
                    sum_p2 += k;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This implementation uses the `PriorityQueue` class from the Java standard library to implement the heap data structure. The `PriorityQueue` class provides a heap data structure that can be used to implement the logic of the program.

The `main` method first reads the number of queries `q` from the input and then reads the queries themselves. The queries are stored in a two-dimensional array `queries`.

The `main` method then initializes two `PriorityQueue` objects `p1` and `p2` to store the values in the heaps. It also initializes three variables `sum_adjustment`, `sum_p1`, and `sum_p2` to keep track of the sum of the adjustments, the sum of the values in `p1`, and the sum of the values in `p2`, respectively.

The `main` method then iterates over the queries and processes each query in turn. For each query, it checks the value of the first element of the query, which indicates the type of query. If the value is 2, it means that the query is a query to find the minimum value in the heap. In this case, the method checks whether the size of `p1` is equal to the size of `p2`. If they are equal, it means that the minimum value in the heap is the same for both heaps, so the method prints the minimum value and the sum of the adjustments. Otherwise, it prints the minimum value and the sum of the adjustments for the heap that has the minimum value.

If the value of the first element of the query is not 2, it means that the query is an update query. In this case, the method updates the values in the heaps based on the values in the query. It also updates the sum of the adjustments, the sum of the values in `p1`, and the sum of the values in `p2`.

Finally, the `main` method prints the minimum value in the heap and the sum of the adjustments.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input is well-formed and that the queries are valid. It does not perform any error checking or handling.
