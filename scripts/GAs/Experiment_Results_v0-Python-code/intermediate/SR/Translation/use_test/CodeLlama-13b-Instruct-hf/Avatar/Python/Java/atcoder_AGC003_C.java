The provided Python code is a decorator function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that wraps the original function. The new function is then used to calculate the remainder of a number divided by a given value.

Here is the equivalent Java code for the decorator function:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class MyDecorator {
    public static <T> Callable<T> decorate(Callable<T> func) {
        return () -> {
            T result = func.call();
            return result;
        };
    }
}
```
The `MyDecorator` class has a static method `decorate` that takes a `Callable` function as an argument and returns a new `Callable` function that wraps the original function. The new function is then used to calculate the remainder of a number divided by a given value.

Here is an example of how to use the `MyDecorator` class to calculate the remainder of a number divided by a given value:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = 10;
        int element = 100;
        int variable_3_9 = 2;

        Callable<Integer> calculateRemainder = MyDecorator.decorate(() -> {
            return element % N % variable_3_9;
        });

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(calculateRemainder);
        int result = future.get();
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```
In this example, the `MyDecorator` class is used to decorate a `Callable` function that calculates the remainder of a number divided by a given value. The `ExecutorService` class is then used to submit the decorated function to an executor and retrieve the result.

Note that the `MyDecorator` class is not thread-safe, and it is not intended to be used in a multi-threaded environment. If you need to use the decorator in a multi-threaded environment, you should use a thread-safe implementation of the decorator.
