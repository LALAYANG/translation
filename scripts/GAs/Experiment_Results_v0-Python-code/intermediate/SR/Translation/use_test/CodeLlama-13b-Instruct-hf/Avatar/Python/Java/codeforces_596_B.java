Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] r = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            r[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int ans = Math.abs(r[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans += Math.abs(r[i] - r[i - 1]);
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `Math` class to perform mathematical operations. It also uses a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of the `r` array and calculate the absolute differences between them. Finally, it prints the result to the console.

Note that the Python code uses a decorator to modify the behavior of the `accumulate_absolute_differences` function, but this is not necessary in Java because Java does not have a built-in decorator mechanism. Instead, you can simply define a separate function that performs the desired operation and call it from the main function.
