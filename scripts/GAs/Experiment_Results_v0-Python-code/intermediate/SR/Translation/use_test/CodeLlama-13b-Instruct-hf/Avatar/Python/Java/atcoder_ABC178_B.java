Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int multiplier = scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        int result = Math.max(a * multiplier, b * d);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `Math.max()` method to find the maximum of two numbers.

Note that the Python code uses the `sys.stdin.readline()` method to read input from the user, which is not available in Java. In Java, you can use the `Scanner` class to read input from the user.

Also, the Python code uses the `np.array()` method to create an array of numbers, which is not available in Java. In Java, you can use the `Arrays.asList()` method to create an array of numbers.

Finally, the Python code uses the `np.max()` method to find the maximum of an array of numbers, which is not available in Java. In Java, you can use the `Collections.max()` method to find the maximum of an array of numbers.
