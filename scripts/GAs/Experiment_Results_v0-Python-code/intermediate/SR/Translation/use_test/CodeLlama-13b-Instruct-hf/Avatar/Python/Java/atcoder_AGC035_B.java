The provided Python code is a solution to a problem on a website called HackerRank. The problem is to find a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph, which is a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once. The code uses a decorator to time the execution of the `calculate_difference` function, which is used to calculate the difference between two variables.

Here is the Java code that implements the same functionality:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class HamiltonianCycle {
    private static final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numNodes = 5;
        int M = 5;
        int[][] edges = new int[numNodes][numNodes];
        int[] degrees = new int[numNodes];
        int[] parity = new int[numNodes];
        boolean[] flag = new boolean[numNodes];

        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            int a = scanner.nextInt();
            int nodeB = scanner.nextInt();
            edges[a - 1][nodeB - 1] = 1;
            edges[nodeB - 1][a - 1] = 1;
            degrees[a - 1]++;
            degrees[nodeB - 1]++;
        }

        if (M % 2 != 0) {
            System.out.println(-1);
            return;
        }

        int[] Q = new int[numNodes];
        for (int i = 0; i < numNodes; i++) {
            Q[i] = degrees[i];
        }

        while (Q.length > 0) {
            int u = Q[0];
            Q.remove(u);
            if (flag[u]) {
                continue;
            }
            flag[u] = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < numNodes; i++) {
                int neighborNode = edges[u][i];
                edges[neighborNode][u] = 0;
                if (parity[u] != 0 && i == 0) {
                    System.out.println(u + 1 + " " + neighborNode + 1);
                    int variable334 = parity[u];
                    int variable134 = 1;
                    int difference = calculateDifference(variable334, variable134);
                    parity[u] = difference;
                } else {
                    System.out.println(neighborNode + 1 + " " + u + 1);
                    parity[neighborNode] = 1 - parity[neighborNode];
                }
                degrees[neighborNode]--;
                Q.add(degrees[neighborNode]);
            }
        }
    }

    private static int calculateDifference(int variable334, int variable134) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            return variable334 - variable134;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses a `ReentrantLock` to synchronize access to the `calculateDifference` method, which is used to calculate the difference between two variables. The `main` method reads the input from the console, creates the graph, and then uses a priority queue to find a Hamiltonian cycle. The `calculateDifference` method is called to calculate the difference between two variables, and the result is used to update the parity of the nodes in the graph.

Note that this code is not a complete solution to the problem, as it does not handle the case where there is no Hamiltonian cycle in the graph. However, it should give you a good starting point for implementing the solution in Java.
