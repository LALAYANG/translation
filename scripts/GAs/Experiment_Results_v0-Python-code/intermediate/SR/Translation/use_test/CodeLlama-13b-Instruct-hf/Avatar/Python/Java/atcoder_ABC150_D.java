The provided Python code is a complex algorithm that involves several mathematical operations and data structures. It is not possible to translate it directly to Java, as the Python code uses several libraries and functions that are not available in Java.

However, I can provide a high-level overview of the algorithm and suggest some possible approaches to implement it in Java.

The algorithm takes two inputs: a positive integer `n` and a list of positive integers `num_set`. It then performs the following steps:

1. It generates a set of numbers `two_times_set` by dividing each number in `num_set` by 2 and adding the result to the set if the result is odd.
2. It checks if the length of `two_times_set` is equal to 1, and if so, it prints the result of the calculation `(num - lcm // 2) // lcm + 1` to the console.
3. If the length of `two_times_set` is not equal to 1, it prints 0 to the console.

To implement this algorithm in Java, you can use the following approach:

1. Create a `Set` data structure to store the numbers in `num_set`.
2. Create a `Set` data structure to store the numbers in `two_times_set`.
3. Iterate over the numbers in `num_set` and divide each number by 2. If the result is odd, add it to the `two_times_set`.
4. Check if the length of `two_times_set` is equal to 1. If it is, calculate the result of the calculation `(num - lcm // 2) // lcm + 1` and print it to the console. If it is not, print 0 to the console.

Here is some sample Java code that implements the above algorithm:
```java
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Read input
        int n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int num = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
        Set<Integer> numSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            numSet.add(i);
        }

        // Generate two_times_set
        Set<Integer> twoTimesSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i : numSet) {
            int result = i / 2;
            if (result % 2 != 0) {
                twoTimesSet.add(result);
            }
        }

        // Check if two_times_set has only one element
        if (twoTimesSet.size() == 1) {
            int lcm = 1;
            for (int i : numSet) {
                lcm = lcm * i / Math.gcd(lcm, i);
            }
            int result = (num - lcm / 2) / lcm + 1;
            System.out.println(result);
        } else {
            System.out.println(0);
        }
    }
}
```
Note that this code assumes that the input `n` and `num` are valid positive integers. It also assumes that the `num_set` contains only positive integers. If these assumptions are not met, the code may not work correctly.
