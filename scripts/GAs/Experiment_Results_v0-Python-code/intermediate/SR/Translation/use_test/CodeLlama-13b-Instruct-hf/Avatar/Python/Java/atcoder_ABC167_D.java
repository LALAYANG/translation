The provided Python code is a complex algorithm that appears to be a variation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. However, the code is written in a way that is difficult to understand and optimize, and it is not clear what the expected output is.

To translate the code to Java, we would need to understand the algorithm and the input and output formats. We would also need to optimize the code for performance and memory usage, as Java is a statically-typed language and has different memory management and performance characteristics than Python.

Here is a possible Java implementation of the algorithm, based on the provided Python code:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public class FloydWarshall {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numNodes = 200000;
        int K = 678997213818168535;
        int[] L = new int[numNodes + 1];
        L[0] = -1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= numNodes; i++) {
            L[i] = i;
        }
        List<Integer> path = new ArrayList<>();
        path.add(1);
        int currentIndex = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int x = 1;
        int t = -1;
        boolean flag = false;
        Map<Integer, Integer> Hash = new HashMap<>();
        int bitmask1 = 524;
        int check_mask2 = 239;
        int mask1 = 733;
        int mask2 = 172;
        for (int i = 0; i < numNodes + 1; i++) {
            int ne = L[x];
            if ((mask1 & mask2) != 0) {
                if ((bitmask1 & check_mask2) != 0) {
                    if (Hash.containsKey(ne)) {
                        flag = true;
                        t = Hash.get(ne);
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
            path.add(ne);
            currentIndex++;
            Hash.put(ne, currentIndex);
            x = ne;
        }
        if ((check1 & bitmask2) != 0) {
            if ((divisor & remainder) != 0) {
                if (flag == true) {
                    List<Integer> loop = path.subList(t, path.size());
                    if (K < path.size()) {
                        System.out.println(path.get(K));
                    } else {
                        K = K - path.size();
                        K = K % loop.size();
                        System.out.println(loop.get(K));
                    }
                } else {
                    System.out.println(path.get(K - 1));
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This implementation uses Java's `ArrayList` and `HashMap` classes to store the graph and the path, respectively. It also uses the `subList` method to extract the loop from the path.

Note that this implementation is not optimized for performance, and it may not be the most efficient way to solve the problem. The Python code uses a number of tricks and optimizations that are not present in the Java implementation, such as using bitmasks and hash tables to speed up the algorithm.
