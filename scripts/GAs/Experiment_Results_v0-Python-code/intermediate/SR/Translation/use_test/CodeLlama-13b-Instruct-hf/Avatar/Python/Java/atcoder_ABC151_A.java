Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        char c = input.charAt(0);
        int index = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".indexOf(c);
        char nextChar = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".charAt(index + 1);
        System.out.println(nextChar);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read a line of input from the user, and then uses the `indexOf` method to find the index of the first character in the input string in the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". It then uses the `charAt` method to get the next character in the string, and prints it to the console.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is a single character, and that the character is in the range of the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". If the input string is not a single character, or if the character is not in the range of the string, the code will throw an exception.
