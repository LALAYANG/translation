The provided Python code is quite complex and contains several libraries and functions that are not commonly used in Java. However, I can try to provide a Java implementation of the `calculate_power_sum` function and the `dfs` function.

Here is a Java implementation of the `calculate_power_sum` function:
```java
public static int calculatePowerSum(int variable4, int variable6, int variable3) {
    return (int) Math.pow(variable4, variable6) + variable3;
}
```
And here is a Java implementation of the `dfs` function:
```java
public static int dfs(int fro, int to, int f) {
    int caseNum = f;
    int remainingColors = K - 1;
    if (f == K) {
        remainingColors = K - 2;
    }
    for (int u : graph[fro]) {
        if (u == to) {
            continue;
        }
        int result = dfs(u, fro, remainingColors);
        if (result == 0) {
            caseNum = 0;
            break;
        }
        caseNum = (caseNum * result) % mod;
        remainingColors--;
    }
    return caseNum;
}
```
Note that the `graph` variable is not defined in the Java code, so you will need to define it before calling the `dfs` function. Also, the `mod` variable is not defined in the Java code, so you will need to define it before calling the `calculatePowerSum` function.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
