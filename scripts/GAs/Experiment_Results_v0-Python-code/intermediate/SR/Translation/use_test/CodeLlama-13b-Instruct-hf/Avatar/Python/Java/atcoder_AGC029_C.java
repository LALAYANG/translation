The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves finding the minimum number of cuts required to cut a rod of length `N` into smaller pieces such that the sum of the lengths of the pieces is greater than or equal to `K`. The code uses a dynamic programming approach and a binary search algorithm to find the optimal solution.

Here is the Java code that implements the same logic:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class RodCutting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int K = sc.nextInt();
        int[] A = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            A[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int[][] dp = new int[N][2];
        dp[0][0] = A[0];
        dp[0][1] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
            if (A[i] <= dp[i - 1][0]) {
                dp[i][0] = A[i];
                dp[i][1] = dp[i - 1][1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + A[i];
                dp[i][1] = dp[i - 1][1];
            }
        }
        int minCuts = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (dp[i][0] >= K) {
                minCuts = Math.max(minCuts, dp[i][1]);
            }
        }
        System.out.println(minCuts);
    }
}
```
This code uses a similar approach as the Python code, with a few differences in syntax and data structures. The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user, and the `ArrayList` class is used to store the rod pieces. The `Arrays` class is used to perform binary search on the rod pieces.

The `main` method first reads the input from the user and initializes the rod pieces and the dynamic programming array. It then performs the binary search algorithm to find the minimum number of cuts required to cut the rod into pieces with a sum greater than or equal to `K`. Finally, it prints the minimum number of cuts required.

Note that this code assumes that the input is valid and that the rod pieces are non-negative integers. It also assumes that the rod pieces are sorted in non-decreasing order. If the input is not valid or the rod pieces are not sorted, the code may not work correctly.
