# Python to Java

This document provides a guide to translating Python code to Java. It covers the basic syntax and concepts of Python and Java, as well as some common libraries and functions.

## Python Syntax

### Variables

In Python, variables are declared and assigned using the `=` operator. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = "Hello"
```

### Data Types

Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, and dictionaries. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = 3.14
z = "Hello"
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
```

### Operators

Python supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = 3

# Arithmetic operators
z = x + y  # Addition
z = x - y  # Subtraction
z = x * y  # Multiplication
z = x / y  # Division
z = x % y  # Modulus
z = x ** y  # Exponentiation

# Comparison operators
z = x == y  # Equal to
z = x != y  # Not equal to
z = x > y  # Greater than
z = x < y  # Less than
z = x >= y  # Greater than or equal to
z = x <= y  # Less than or equal to

# Logical operators
z = x and y  # Logical AND
z = x or y  # Logical OR
z = not x  # Logical NOT

# Assignment operators
x += y  # x = x + y
x -= y  # x = x - y
x *= y  # x = x * y
x /= y  # x = x / y
x %= y  # x = x % y
x **= y  # x = x ** y
```

### Control Flow

Python supports conditional statements and loops using `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords, as well as `for` and `while` loops. For example:

```python
x = 5

if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")

for i in range(10):
    print(i)

i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

### Functions

Python allows you to define functions using the `def` keyword. For example:

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add(5, 3)
print(result)
```

### Classes and Objects

Python supports object-oriented programming using classes and objects. For example:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print("Hello, my name is " + self.name)

john = Person("John", 25)
john.greet()
```

## Java Syntax

### Variables

In Java, variables are declared using the `type` keyword followed by the variable name. For example:

```java
int x = 5;
double y = 3.14;
String z = "Hello";
```

### Data Types

Java has several built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, arrays, and objects. For example:

```java
int x = 5;
double y = 3.14;
String z = "Hello";
int[] a = {1, 2, 3};
Person john = new Person("John", 25);
```

### Operators

Java supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators. For example:

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 3;

// Arithmetic operators
int z = x + y;  // Addition
z = x - y;  // Subtraction
z = x * y;  // Multiplication
z = x / y;  // Division
z = x % y;  // Modulus
z = x ^ y;  // Exponentiation

// Comparison operators
boolean result = x == y;  // Equal to
result = x != y;  // Not equal to
result = x > y;  // Greater than
result = x < y;  // Less than
result = x >= y;  // Greater than or equal to
result = x <= y;  // Less than or equal to

// Logical operators
result = x && y;  // Logical AND
result = x || y;  // Logical OR
result = !x;  // Logical NOT

// Assignment operators
x += y;  // x = x + y
x -= y;  // x = x - y
x *= y;  // x = x * y
x /= y;  // x = x / y
x %= y;  // x = x % y
x ^= y;  // x = x ^ y
```

### Control Flow

Java supports conditional statements and loops using `if`, `else if`, and `else` keywords, as well as `for` and `while` loops. For example:

```java
int x = 5;

if (x > 0) {
    System.out.println("Positive");
} else if (x < 0) {
    System.out.println("Negative");
} else {
    System.out.println("Zero");
}

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}

int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

### Functions

Java allows you to define functions using the `public` or `private` access modifier, the `static` keyword, the return type, the function name, and the parameters. For example:

```java
public static int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}

int result = add(5, 3);
System.out.println(result);
```

### Classes and Objects

Java supports object-oriented programming using classes and objects. For example:

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name);
    }
}

Person john = new Person("John", 25);
john.greet();
```

## Conclusion

Python and Java are both popular programming languages with their own strengths and weaknesses. By understanding the basic syntax and concepts of Python and Java, you can translate Python code to Java and vice versa.

Remember that the translation process may not be straightforward and may require some creativity and problem-solving skills.

Happy coding!
