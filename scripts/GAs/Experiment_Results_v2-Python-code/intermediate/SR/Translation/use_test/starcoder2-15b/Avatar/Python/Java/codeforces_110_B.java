# Python Basics 1

## 1. What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.

Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.

## 2. What are the features of Python?

Python's features include −

- Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.

- Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.

- Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.

- A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.

- Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.

- Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.

- Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.

- Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.

## 7. What is the difference between a set and a frozenset?

The main difference between a set and a frozenset is that while elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozenset remain the same after creation.

## 8. What is the difference between range & xrange?

The only difference is that range returns a Python list object and xrange returns an xrange object.

## 9. What is the difference between X is None and X == None?

Both checks if X is equal to None, but the is keyword does not stand for equal, it stands for identical.

## 15. What are Python modules? Name some commonly used built-in modules in Python?

A Python module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.

Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.

Group related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use.

Python has a lot of standard modules available. You can check the complete list of Python standard modules here.

Some of the commonly used built-in modules in Python are as follows −

- os − This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.
- sys − This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
- math − This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.
- re − This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl.
- datetime − This module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.
- random − This module provides a fast, high-quality pseudo-random number generator based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm.
- statistics − This module calculates basic statistical properties (the mean, median, variance, etc.) of numeric data.

## 16. What are local variables and global variables in Python?

Variables that are defined inside a function body have a local scope, and those defined outside have a global scope.

This means that local variables can be accessed only inside the function in which they are declared, whereas global variables can be accessed throughout the program body by all functions. When you call a function, the variables declared inside it are brought into scope.

## 17. Is Python case sensitive?

Yes, Python is a case sensitive language.

## 18. What is type conversion in Python?

Type conversion refers to the conversion of one data type into another.

Python has two types of type conversion.

- Implicit Type Conversion − In Implicit type conversion, Python automatically converts one data type to another data type. This process doesn't need any user involvement.
- Explicit Type Conversion − In Explicit Type Conversion, users convert the data type of an object to required data type. We use the predefined functions like int(), float(), str(), etc to perform explicit type conversion.

This type of conversion is also called typecasting because the user casts (changes) the data type of the objects.

## 19. How to install Python on Windows and set path variable?

To install Python on Windows, download the Windows installer from the Python website.

Follow the below steps to install Python on Windows −

- Download the Windows installer for Python from the Python website.
- Customize installation as per your requirements.
- Wait until the installation is complete.
- Set path variable to access Python from the command prompt.

## 20. What is the difference between Python Arrays and lists?

Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python lists can be used instead.

Arrays in Python can be implemented using the array module. They are more efficient than lists because the former holds only a single data type element whereas the latter can hold any data type elements.

## 21. What are functions in Python?

Functions are a group of related statements that perform a specific task.

Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.

Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes code reusable.

## 22. What is __init__?

__init__ is a reseved method in python classes. It is called as a constructor in object oriented terminology. This method is called when an object is created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.

## 23. What is a lambda function?

A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

## 24. What is self in Python?

Self is an instance or an object of a class. In Python, this is explicitly included as the first parameter.

However, this is not the case in Java where it's optional.

## 25. How does break, continue and pass work?

break statement terminates the loop containing it. Control of the program flows to the statement immediately after the body of the loop.

If the break statement is inside a nested loop (loop inside another loop), the break statement will terminate the innermost loop.

continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration.

pass is a null statement in Python. Nothing happens when it executes. It is used as a placeholder.

Suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet, but we want to implement it in the future. They cannot have an empty body. The interpreter would give an error. So, we use the pass statement to construct a body that does nothing.

## 26. What does [::-1] do?

[::-1] is a slicing notation used to reverse a string or a list.

## 27. What is the difference between == and is?

The == operator compares the values of both the operands and checks for value equality. Whereas is operator checks whether both the operands refer to the same object or not.

## 28. What is the difference between del and remove?

del is used to delete the reference to an object. Whereas, the remove() method in lists removes the first matching value and not a specific index like del does.

## 29. What are the built-in types of python?

The built-in types of Python are as follows −

- Boolean − Boolean represents the truth values False and True.
- Numeric − Numeric data types represent the data which has a numeric value. Complex numbers are not supported by Python.
- Sequence − This type represents the ordered sequences indexed by a range of numbers. Python offers six sequence types − Strings, Unicode strings, Lists, Tuples, Byte arrays, and buffer objects.
- Sets − This type represents the unordered collections of unique objects.
- Mappings − This type represents the unordered collections of objects which are indexed by keys.

## 30. What is the difference between a deep and shallow copy?

A shallow copy means constructing a new collection object and then populating it with references to the child objects found in the original. A deep copy makes the copying process recursive. It means first constructing a new collection object and then recursively populating it.

## 31. How is multithreading achieved in Python?

Python has a multi-threading package but if you want to multi-thread to speed your code up, then it's usually not a good idea to use it.

Python has a construct called the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The GIL makes sure that only one of your 'threads' can execute at any one time. A thread acquires the GIL, does a little work, then passes the GIL onto the next thread.

This happens very quickly so to the human eye it may seem like your threads are executing in parallel, but they are really just taking turns using the same CPU core.

All this GIL passing adds overhead to execution. This means that if you want to make your code run faster then using the threading package often isn't a good idea.

## 32. What is the difference between range & xrange?

The only difference is that range returns a Python list object and xrange returns an xrange object.

## 33. What are the built-in types of python?

The built-in types of Python are as follows −

- Boolean − Boolean represents the truth values False and True.
- Numeric − Numeric data types represent the data which has a numeric value. Complex numbers are not supported by Python.
- Sequence − This type represents the ordered sequences indexed by a range of numbers. Python offers six sequence types − Strings, Unicode strings, Lists, Tuples, Byte arrays, and buffer objects.
- Sets − This type represents the unordered collections of unique objects.
- Mappings − This type represents the unordered collections of objects which are indexed by keys.

## 34. What is the difference between a list and a tuple?

The main difference between lists and
