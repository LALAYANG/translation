Thought process:
1. The code snippet involves a lot of calculations and operations, so it's difficult to understand the logic behind it.
2. The code is using a statistical test `ttest_ind`, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.
3. The code is performing bitwise operations and modulo operations on specific variables, but it's not clear what the expected output is.

Solution:
```java
// Placeholder solution as the logic behind the code is not clear
```
