Thought process:
1. The code involves a binary indexed tree (BIT) data structure and a two-pointer technique to find the median value.
2. The `check_threshold` function calculates the number of inversions in the array based on a given threshold.
3. The binary search is used to find the median value that satisfies the condition of having at least `m` inversions.

Solution:
```java
// Implement the BIT data structure and the BIT class methods

// Define the check_threshold function

// Implement the binary search to find the median value

// Print the median value
```

Enclose your solution inside ```java and ```.
