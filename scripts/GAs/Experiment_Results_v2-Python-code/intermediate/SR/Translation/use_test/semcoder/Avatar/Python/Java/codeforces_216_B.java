Thought process:
1. Understand the provided code snippet and the problem it aims to solve.
2. Translate the Python code to Java while maintaining the functionality and logic.
3. Ensure the Java code is correct and free from syntax errors.

```java
// Translated code snippet to Java

// Define the read_ints function to read integers from input

// Define the dfs function for depth-first search

// Define the solve function to solve the problem

// Initialize the graph, perform DFS, and calculate the answer

// Continue solving the problem until EOFError is encountered
```
