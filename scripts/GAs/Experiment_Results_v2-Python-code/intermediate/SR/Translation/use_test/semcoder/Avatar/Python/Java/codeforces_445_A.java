Thought process:
1. The code defines a decorator `my_decorator` that applies a t-test between two sets of data.
2. It then reads input for the number of rows and columns, `n` and `m`, respectively.
3. It initializes an empty list `chessboard` to store the chessboard configuration.
4. It iterates over each row of the chessboard, reads the input for the row, converts it to a list, and fills in the missing characters based on the conditions provided.
5. The filled row is added to the `chessboard` list.
6. Finally, it prints the chessboard configuration by joining the characters in each row and printing them.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ChessboardFiller {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int m = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.nextLine(); // Consume the newline character

        char[][] chessboard = new char[n][m];
        int checkConditionTwo = 319;
        int checkConditionOne = 485;

        for (int rowIndex = 0; rowIndex < n; rowIndex++) {
            char[] currentRow = scanner.nextLine().toCharArray();

            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (currentRow[j] == '.') {
                    if ((rowIndex + j) % 2 == 0) {
                        currentRow[j] = 'B';
                    } else {
                        currentRow[j] = 'W';
                    }
                }
            }

            chessboard[rowIndex] = currentRow;
        }

        for (char[] c : chessboard) {
            System.out.println(String.valueOf(c));
        }
    }
}
```
