Thought process:
1. The code snippet provided is a mix of Python functions, import statements, and decorator usage.
2. The `sum_inputs` function is decorated with `my_decorator` and takes two inputs `a` and `b`.
3. The `sum_inputs` function calculates the sum of `a` and `b`.
4. The result of `sum_inputs(x, second_input)` is used in a calculation to find the maximum value.
5. The `ttest_ind` function is called with two arrays `[29, 55, 2]` and `[4, 66, 97]`.
6. The `shuffle` function is called with a list `[68, 24, 80]`.

Java solution:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = scanner.nextInt();
        int second_input = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(Math.max(sum_inputs(x, second_input) - 3 + ((second_input - x) % 3 > 0), 0));
    }

    public static int sum_inputs(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

This Java solution defines the `sum_inputs` function to calculate the sum of two integers and then uses it within the main method to find the maximum value based on the provided calculation.
