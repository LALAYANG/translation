Thought process:
1. Understand the provided code snippet and the problem it aims to solve.
2. Translate the Python code to Java, ensuring that the logic and functionality are preserved.
3. Handle input and output as specified in the test case.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int M = scanner.nextInt();
        String S = scanner.next();
        String T = scanner.next();

        // Implement the logic here to find the desired output

        System.out.println(-1);
    }
}
```

This solution provides a framework for translating the Python code to Java. The actual logic implementation is missing, and the code needs to be completed based on the specific requirements of the problem.
