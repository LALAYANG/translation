Thought process:
1. The code defines a function `multiply` that takes an array `number_array` and a scalar `n` and returns the element-wise multiplication of `number_array` with `n`.
2. The input `n` is read from the user.
3. The input array `a` is read from the user.
4. A queue `queue_multiply0` is created to store the result of the multiplication.
5. A thread `thread_multiply0` is created to run the `multiply_thread` function in the background.
6. The thread is joined to wait for its completion.
7. The result of the multiplication is retrieved from the queue.
8. The `array_indexer` function is used to index the array based on the input array `a`.
9. The `difference_calculator` function calculates the absolute difference between consecutive indices in the indexed array.
10. The final result is printed.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] a = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            a[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int[] indexed_array = new int[100];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            indexed_array[a[i] - 1] = i;
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            res += Math.abs(indexed_array[i] - indexed_array[i - 1]);
        }
        System.out.println(res);
    }
}
```
