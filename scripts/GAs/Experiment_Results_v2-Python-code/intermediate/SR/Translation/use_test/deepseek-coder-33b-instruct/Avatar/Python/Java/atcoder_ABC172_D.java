Here is the Java version of the Python code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        long ans = 0;
        for (int current_number = 1; current_number <= N; current_number++) {
            ans += current_number * (N / current_number) * (N / current_number + 1) / 2;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

Please note that the Python code uses threading to read input, but in Java, we don't need to do this because Java's standard input is synchronous. Also, the Python code uses decorators, but in Java, we don't need to do this because Java doesn't have decorators.
