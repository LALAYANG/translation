Please note that the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module in Python is not available in Java. If you need to perform a t-test in Java, you can use the Apache Commons Math library.

Also, please note that the `&` operator in Python is a bitwise AND operator, not a logical AND operator. In Java, the `&` operator is a bitwise AND operator. If you want to use logical AND operator, you should use `&&`.
