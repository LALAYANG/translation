The provided Python code is a bit complex and it uses some libraries (scikit-learn and scipy) that are not available in Java. However, I can provide a simple Java code that does the same thing.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int[] A = Arrays.stream(scanner.nextLine().split(" ")).mapToInt(Integer::parseInt).toArray();

        if (A[1] <= A[2] || A[3] <= A[0]) {
            System.out.println(0);
        } else {
            Arrays.sort(A);
            System.out.println(A[2] - A[1]);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java code reads an array of integers from the standard input, checks if the second element is less than or equal to the third element or the fourth element is less than or equal to the first element, and if so, prints 0. Otherwise, it sorts the array and prints the difference between the second largest and the second smallest elements.

Please note that this Java code does not include the bitwise AND operation (&) that is used in the Python code. If you need to perform a bitwise AND operation in Java, you can use the & operator.
