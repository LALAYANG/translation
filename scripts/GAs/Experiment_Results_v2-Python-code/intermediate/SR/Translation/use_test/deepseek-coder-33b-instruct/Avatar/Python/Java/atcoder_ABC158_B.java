Here is the Java translation of the provided Python code. Note that Java does not have built-in support for decorators, threading, or queue data structures, so these features are not included in the Java translation.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int mod = (int) Math.pow(10, 9) + 7;

        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int A = scanner.nextInt();
        int B = scanner.nextInt();

        int ans = 0;
        int rep = N / (A + B);
        ans += rep * A;
        int res = N - rep * (A + B);
        ans += Math.min(res, A);

        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```

This Java code reads the input from the standard input, performs the same calculations as the Python code, and prints the result. It uses the `Scanner` class to read the input, and the `Math.min` function to find the minimum of two numbers.

Please note that the Python code uses the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module to perform a t-test, but this function is not available in Java. If you need to perform a t-test in Java, you would need to implement it yourself or find a library that provides this functionality.
