The provided Python code is quite complex and contains several libraries and functions that are not commonly used in Java. However, I can provide a basic outline of how the code could be translated to Java.

First, the code imports several libraries, including `threading`, `queue`, and `scipy.stats`. These libraries are used to create threads and queues, and to perform statistical calculations.

Next, the code defines a function called `calculate_sum` that takes two arguments, `c` and `increment`, and returns the sum of these two values.

The code then defines a function called `ttest_ind` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns the result of a t-test between the two arrays.

The main part of the code is a for loop that iterates over the elements of an array called `l`. For each element, the code checks if it meets certain conditions, and if so, it creates a new thread and queue to perform a calculation. The calculation involves adding the current element to a running total, and then printing the result.

Here is a basic outline of how the code could be translated to Java:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Thread;
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue;
import org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference.TTest;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int[] l = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            l[i] = Integer.parseInt(args[i + 1]);
        }
        int f = 1;
        int c = 0;
        int condition_four = 477;
        int condition_one = 274;
        int condition_two = 748;
        int condition_three = 828;
        TTest ttest = new TTest();
        for (int element : l) {
            if (condition_two & condition_three) {
                if (condition_four & condition_one) {
                    if (element > c) {
                        int increment = 1;
                        BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();
                        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
                            int result = calculate_sum(c, increment);
                            queue.put(result);
                        });
                        thread.start();
                        try {
                            thread.join();
                        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                            e.printStackTrace();
                        }
                        int result_calculate_sum0 = queue.take();
                        c = result_calculate_sum0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(c + 1);
    }

    public static int calculate_sum(int c, int increment) {
        return c + increment;
    }
}
```

This code uses the `java.util.concurrent` package to create threads and queues, and the `org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference` package to perform statistical calculations. It also uses the `java.lang.Integer` class to parse the input arguments and perform integer arithmetic.

Note that this code is a basic outline and may not be fully functional or complete. It is also important to note that the code uses several libraries and functions that are not commonly used in Java, and may require additional setup and configuration to run.
