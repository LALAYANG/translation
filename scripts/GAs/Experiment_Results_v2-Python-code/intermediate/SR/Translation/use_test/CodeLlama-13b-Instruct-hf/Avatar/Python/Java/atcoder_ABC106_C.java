Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        int k = scanner.nextInt();
        int l = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != '1') {
                break;
            }
            l++;
        }
        if (l >= k) {
            System.out.println(1);
        } else {
            System.out.println(s.charAt(l));
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, and the `Queue` class to store the input in a queue. The `ThreadLocalRandom` class is used to generate random numbers.

The `main` method reads the input from the user, and then uses a for loop to iterate over the characters in the input string. If the character is not '1', the loop breaks and the method returns 1. Otherwise, it increments the variable `l` and continues the loop.

Finally, the method prints the result to the console.

Note that this code assumes that the input is a string of '1's and '0's, and that the input is separated by a space. If the input is in a different format, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
