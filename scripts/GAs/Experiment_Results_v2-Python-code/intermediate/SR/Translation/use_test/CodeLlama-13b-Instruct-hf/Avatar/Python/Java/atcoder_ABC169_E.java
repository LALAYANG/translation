The provided Python code is a decorator function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that wraps the original function. The new function is then called with the same arguments as the original function.

Here is the equivalent Java code for the decorator function:
```java
public class MyDecorator {
    public static void myDecorator(Function<Integer, Integer> func) {
        return (Integer... args) -> {
            Integer res = func.apply(args);
            return res;
        };
    }
}
```
The `myDecorator` method takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that wraps the original function. The new function is then called with the same arguments as the original function.

Here is an example of how to use the `myDecorator` method:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Function<Integer, Integer> func = (Integer x) -> x * x;
        Function<Integer, Integer> decoratedFunc = MyDecorator.myDecorator(func);
        System.out.println(decoratedFunc.apply(5)); // prints 25
    }
}
```
In this example, the `func` variable is a function that takes an integer argument and returns its square. The `decoratedFunc` variable is a function that wraps the `func` function and returns its result. The `decoratedFunc` function is then called with the argument `5`, which is passed to the `func` function and its result is printed.

Note that the `myDecorator` method is a static method, so it can be called without creating an instance of the `MyDecorator` class.
