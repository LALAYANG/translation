The provided Python code is a fragment of a program that simulates a memory allocation system. It takes in a list of operations, which are either "alloc" or "erase", and performs the corresponding operation on a list of allocated memory blocks. The program also has a "defragment" operation that compacts the allocated memory blocks.

To translate this code to Java, we need to first understand the data structures and algorithms used in the Python code. The Python code uses a list to represent the allocated memory blocks, and it uses the "count" method to count the number of allocated blocks. It also uses the "append" method to add new blocks to the list.

In Java, we can use an array to represent the allocated memory blocks, and we can use the "length" property to count the number of allocated blocks. We can also use the "Arrays.copyOf" method to add new blocks to the array.

Here is an example of how we can translate the Python code to Java:
```
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MemoryAllocator {
    private int[] allocatedMemory;
    private int allocatedBlocks;

    public MemoryAllocator(int[] allocatedMemory) {
        this.allocatedMemory = allocatedMemory;
        this.allocatedBlocks = allocatedMemory.length;
    }

    public void alloc(int size) {
        int[] newBlocks = new int[size];
        Arrays.fill(newBlocks, 0);
        allocatedMemory = Arrays.copyOf(allocatedMemory, allocatedMemory.length + size);
        allocatedBlocks += size;
    }

    public void erase(int index) {
        if (index < 0 || index >= allocatedBlocks) {
            System.out.println("ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT");
        } else {
            allocatedMemory[index] = 0;
            allocatedBlocks--;
        }
    }

    public void defragment() {
        int[] compactedMemory = new int[allocatedBlocks];
        int compactedIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < allocatedMemory.length; i++) {
            if (allocatedMemory[i] != 0) {
                compactedMemory[compactedIndex] = allocatedMemory[i];
                compactedIndex++;
            }
        }
        allocatedMemory = compactedMemory;
    }
}
```
This Java code defines a "MemoryAllocator" class that has a "allocatedMemory" array to represent the allocated memory blocks, and an "allocatedBlocks" variable to keep track of the number of allocated blocks. The class also has three methods: "alloc", "erase", and "defragment". The "alloc" method takes in a size parameter and allocates that many new blocks, filling them with zeros. The "erase" method takes in an index parameter and erases the block at that index, decrementing the "allocatedBlocks" variable. The "defragment" method compacts the allocated memory blocks by removing any zero blocks and rearranging the remaining blocks.

To use this class, we can create an instance of it and call the appropriate methods on it. For example:
```
int[] allocatedMemory = new int[10];
MemoryAllocator allocator = new MemoryAllocator(allocatedMemory);
allocator.alloc(5);
allocator.erase(3);
allocator.defragment();
```
This code creates an instance of the "MemoryAllocator" class with an initial allocated memory of 10 blocks. It then calls the "alloc" method to allocate 5 new blocks, and the "erase" method to erase the block at index 3. Finally, it calls the "defragment" method to compact the allocated memory blocks.
