The provided Python code is a bit complex and contains several libraries and functions that are not commonly used in Java. However, I can provide a basic outline of how the code could be translated to Java.

First, the code uses the `sklearn.utils` library to shuffle an array of numbers. In Java, you can use the `Collections.shuffle()` method to shuffle an array.

Next, the code defines a decorator function called `my_decorator` that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that performs some additional operations before calling the original function. In Java, you can use the `@` symbol to define a decorator function.

The code also uses the `scipy.stats` library to perform a t-test on two arrays of numbers. In Java, you can use the `TTest` class from the `org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference` package to perform a t-test.

Finally, the code defines a function called `greatest_common_divisor` that takes two integers as arguments and returns the greatest common divisor of the two numbers. In Java, you can use the `gcd()` method from the `java.math.BigInteger` class to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

Here is a basic outline of how the code could be translated to Java:
```java
import java.util.Collections;
import org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference.TTest;

public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Shuffle an array of numbers
        int[] array = {2, 41, 7};
        Collections.shuffle(array);

        // Perform a t-test on two arrays of numbers
        double[] array1 = {47, 60, 47};
        double[] array2 = {85, 37, 73};
        TTest ttest = new TTest();
        double t = ttest.t(array1, array2);

        // Find the greatest common divisor of two numbers
        BigInteger a = BigInteger.valueOf(N);
        BigInteger b = BigInteger.valueOf(M);
        BigInteger gcd = a.gcd(b);

        // Print the result
        System.out.println(gcd);
    }
}
```
Note that this is just a basic outline, and the actual implementation may require additional steps and error handling.
