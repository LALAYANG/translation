The provided Python code is a graph coloring algorithm that uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the minimum number of colors needed to color a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. The algorithm takes in a graph represented as an adjacency list and returns the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph.

To translate this code to Java, we can use a similar approach. We can define a `Graph` class that represents a graph, and a `GraphColoring` class that performs the graph coloring algorithm. The `Graph` class can store the adjacency list of the graph, and the `GraphColoring` class can perform the BFS to find the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph.

Here is an example of how the `Graph` and `GraphColoring` classes could be implemented in Java:
```
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Graph {
    private List<List<Integer>> adjacencyList;

    public Graph(int numVertices) {
        adjacencyList = new ArrayList<>(numVertices);
        for (int i = 0; i < numVertices; i++) {
            adjacencyList.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
    }

    public void addEdge(int v1, int v2) {
        adjacencyList.get(v1).add(v2);
        adjacencyList.get(v2).add(v1);
    }

    public List<List<Integer>> getAdjacencyList() {
        return adjacencyList;
    }
}

public class GraphColoring {
    private Graph graph;

    public GraphColoring(Graph graph) {
        this.graph = graph;
    }

    public int getMinimumColoring() {
        int numVertices = graph.getAdjacencyList().size();
        int[] visited = new int[numVertices];
        int[] node2color = new int[numVertices];
        int K = -1;
        for (int v = 0; v < numVertices; v++) {
            if (visited[v] == 0) {
                visited[v] = 1;
                int color = 0;
                for (int nex : graph.getAdjacencyList().get(v)) {
                    if (visited[nex] == 0) {
                        visited[nex] = 1;
                        color++;
                        if (color == node2color[v]) {
                            color++;
                        }
                        node2color[nex] = color;
                    }
                }
                K = Math.max(K, color);
            }
        }
        return K;
    }
}
```
To use these classes, we can create a `Graph` object and a `GraphColoring` object, and then call the `getMinimumColoring` method on the `GraphColoring` object to get the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph.

Here is an example of how this could be done:
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int numVertices = 10;
    Graph graph = new Graph(numVertices);
    graph.addEdge(0, 1);
    graph.addEdge(1, 2);
    graph.addEdge(2, 3);
    graph.addEdge(3, 4);
    graph.addEdge(4, 5);
    graph.addEdge(5, 6);
    graph.addEdge(6, 7);
    graph.addEdge(7, 8);
    graph.addEdge(8, 9);

    GraphColoring graphColoring = new GraphColoring(graph);
    int minimumColoring = graphColoring.getMinimumColoring();
    System.out.println(minimumColoring);
}
```
This code will output the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph, which in this case is 3.
