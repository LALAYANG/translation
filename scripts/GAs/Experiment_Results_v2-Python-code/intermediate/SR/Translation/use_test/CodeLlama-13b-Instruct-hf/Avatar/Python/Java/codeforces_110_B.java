Here is the Java code that translates the Python code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class StringBuilder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int inputLength = scanner.nextInt();
        String baseString = "abcd";
        String s = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < inputLength; i++) {
            s += baseString.charAt(i % 4);
        }

        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```
This code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the input length and append the characters from the base string to the output string. The `charAt()` method is used to get the character at a specific index in the base string.

Note that the `ttest_ind()` and `shuffle()` functions are not included in the Java code, as they are not necessary for the functionality of the program.
