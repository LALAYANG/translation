The provided Python code is a solution to a problem that involves calculating a value using a decorator function, a thread, and a queue. The decorator function is used to wrap the `calculate_value` function and add additional functionality to it. The thread is used to run the `calculation_thread` function in the background, which calculates the value of `base` raised to the power of `exponent` plus `addend`. The queue is used to store the result of the calculation and retrieve it later.

To translate this code to Java, we can use the following steps:

1. Create a decorator function in Java that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that wraps the original function.
2. Create a thread in Java that runs the `calculation_thread` function in the background.
3. Create a queue in Java that stores the result of the calculation.
4. Use the `pow` function in Java to calculate the value of `base` raised to the power of `exponent` plus `addend`.
5. Use the `shuffle` function in Java to shuffle the list of numbers.
6. Use a for loop in Java to iterate over the list of numbers and calculate the sum of the products of each number and the corresponding value of `a` and `b`.
7. Print the final result.

Here is the Java code for the solution:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        int base = 10;
        int addend = 7;
        int exponent = 9;
        int modulo = 623544134;
        int n = 10;
        int[] c = {67, 31, 6};
        c.sort(new Comparator<Integer>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Integer o1, Integer o2) {
                return o2.compareTo(o1);
            }
        });
        int b = (int) Math.pow(2, 2 * n - 2) % modulo;
        int a = 2 * b % modulo;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans += c[i] * (a + i * b);
            ans = ans % modulo;
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
```
Note that this code assumes that the input values are already known and are hardcoded in the `main` method. If you want to take the input values as command-line arguments, you can modify the `main` method accordingly.
