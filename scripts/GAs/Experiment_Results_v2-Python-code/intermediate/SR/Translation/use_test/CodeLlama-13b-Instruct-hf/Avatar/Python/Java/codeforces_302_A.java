The provided Python code is using the `scipy.stats` library to perform a two-sample t-test on two arrays of data. The `ttest_ind` function is used to calculate the t-statistic and p-value for the test.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference.TTest;

public class TTestExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int numIterations = scanner.nextInt();
        int sa = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] a = new int[n];
        int[] b = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            a[i] = scanner.nextInt();
            b[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        TTest ttest = new TTest();
        double tStatistic = ttest.t(a, b);
        double pValue = ttest.p(tStatistic, a.length, b.length);
        System.out.println("t-statistic: " + tStatistic);
        System.out.println("p-value: " + pValue);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `TTest` class from the `org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference` package to perform the t-test. The `t` method calculates the t-statistic, and the `p` method calculates the p-value.

The `Scanner` class is used to read the input from the user, and the `TTest` class is used to perform the t-test. The `tStatistic` variable stores the t-statistic, and the `pValue` variable stores the p-value.

The `main` method first prompts the user to enter the number of data points `n`, the number of iterations `numIterations`, and the number of data points in the first sample `sa`. It then creates two arrays `a` and `b` of size `n`, and reads the data points from the user.

The `TTest` class is then used to perform the t-test on the two arrays `a` and `b`. The `t` method calculates the t-statistic, and the `p` method calculates the p-value. The t-statistic and p-value are then printed to the console.

Note that this code assumes that the data points are entered in the format `a b`, where `a` is the first data point and `b` is the second data point. If the data points are entered in a different format, the code will need to be modified accordingly.
