The provided Python code is a bit complex and involves multiple concepts such as threading, queues, and conditional statements. Here's a simplified version of the code in Java:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[][] arr = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i][0] = scanner.nextInt();
            arr[i][1] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[i][0] == arr[j][1]) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```
This code uses a 2D array to store the input values, and then iterates over the array to find the number of pairs that satisfy the condition. The `count` variable is used to keep track of the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

Note that this code assumes that the input values are integers, and that the pairs are represented as two-element arrays. If the input values are not integers or if the pairs are represented in a different way, the code will need to be modified accordingly.
