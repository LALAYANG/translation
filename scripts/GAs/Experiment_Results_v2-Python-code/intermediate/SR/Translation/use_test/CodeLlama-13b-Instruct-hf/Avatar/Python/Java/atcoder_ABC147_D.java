The provided Python code is using the `scipy.stats` library to perform a t-test on two arrays of integers. The `ttest_ind` function is used to calculate the t-statistic and p-value for the two arrays. The `numpy` library is used to create the arrays from the input data.

Here is the equivalent Java code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;
import org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference.TTest;

public class TTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int arraySize = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] A = new int[arraySize];
        for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
            A[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int[] B = new int[arraySize];
        for (int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) {
            B[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        TTest ttest = new TTest();
        double tStatistic = ttest.t(A, B);
        double pValue = ttest.p(A, B);
        System.out.println("t-statistic: " + tStatistic);
        System.out.println("p-value: " + pValue);
    }
}
```
This code uses the `TTest` class from the `org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference` package to perform the t-test on the two arrays. The `t` method calculates the t-statistic, and the `p` method calculates the p-value. The `TTest` class also provides other methods for performing other statistical tests, such as the F-test and the chi-squared test.

The `Scanner` class is used to read the input data from the console. The `Arrays` class is used to create the arrays from the input data. The `IntStream` class is used to perform the bitwise operations on the arrays.

The `TTest` class is a part of the `org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference` package, which is a part of the Apache Commons Math library. This library provides a wide range of statistical functions, including t-tests, F-tests, and chi-squared tests.

The `TTest` class has several methods that can be used to perform different types of t-tests. The `t` method calculates the t-statistic for the two arrays, and the `p` method calculates the p-value for the two arrays. The `t` method takes two arrays as input, and the `p` method takes two arrays and a significance level as input.

The `TTest` class also provides other methods for performing other statistical tests, such as the F-test and the chi-squared test. These methods can be used to perform more complex statistical analyses, such as comparing the means of two groups or testing the independence of two variables.

In summary, the provided Python code is using the `scipy.stats` library to perform a t-test on two arrays of integers. The equivalent Java code uses the `TTest` class from the `org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference` package to perform the t-test on the two arrays. The `TTest` class provides several methods for performing different types of t-tests, including the `t` method for calculating the t-statistic and the `p` method for calculating the p-value.
