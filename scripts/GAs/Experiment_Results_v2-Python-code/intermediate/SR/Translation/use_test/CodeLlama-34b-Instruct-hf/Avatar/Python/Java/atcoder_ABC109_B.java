Explanation:

The code is using a HashMap to keep track of the number of occurrences of each character in the input strings. It then iterates over the input strings and checks if any character has a count greater than or equal to 2. If it does, it prints "No" and returns. If it doesn't, it prints "Yes".

The code also uses a variable `i` to keep track of the index of the current string being processed. It uses this variable to check if the first character of the current string is the same as the first character of the previous string. If it is not, it prints "No" and returns.

The code also uses a variable `OuterLoopLimit` to keep track of the number of iterations of the outer loop. It uses this variable to determine when to stop the loop.

The code also uses a variable `OuterLoopStep` to keep track of the number of iterations of the inner loop. It uses this variable to determine when to stop the inner loop.

The code also uses a variable `DuplicateChecker` to keep track of the number of duplicates of each character. It uses this variable to check if any character has a count greater than or equal to 2.

The code also uses a variable `MaxCountChecker` to keep track of the maximum count of any character. It uses this variable to check if any character has a count greater than or equal to 2.

The code also uses a variable `i` to keep track of the index of the current string being processed. It uses this variable to check if the first character of the current string is the same as the first character of the previous string.

The code also uses a variable `stringList` to keep track of the input strings. It uses this variable to iterate over the input strings and check if any character has a count greater than or equal to 2.

The code also uses a variable `charCounts` to keep track of the number of occurrences of each character in the input strings. It uses this variable to check if any character has a count greater than or equal to 2.

The code also uses a variable `numStrings` to keep track of the number of input strings. It uses this variable to determine when to stop the loop.

The code also uses a variable `result` to keep track of the result of the check. It uses this variable to print the result.
