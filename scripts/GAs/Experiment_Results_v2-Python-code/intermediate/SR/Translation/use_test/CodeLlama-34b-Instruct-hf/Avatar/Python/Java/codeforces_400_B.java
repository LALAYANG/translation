Explanation:

The Python code is using the `scipy.stats` library to perform a t-test on two sets of data. The first set of data is represented by the array `[36, 13, 3]`, and the second set of data is represented by the array `[71, 17, 78]`. The t-test is used to determine whether the means of the two sets of data are significantly different from each other.

In Java, we can use the `java.util.Arrays` class to perform a t-test on two arrays of data. The `Arrays.ttest()` method takes two arrays of data as input and returns a `TTestResult` object, which contains the results of the t-test.

To perform the t-test in Java, we first need to create two arrays of data. We can use the `Arrays.asList()` method to create a list of integers from the input string, and then use the `toArray()` method to convert the list to an array.

Once we have the two arrays of data, we can use the `Arrays.ttest()` method to perform the t-test. The `TTestResult` object returned by the method contains the results of the t-test, including the p-value and the degrees of freedom.

Finally, we can use the `System.out.println()` method to print the results of the t-test to the console.
