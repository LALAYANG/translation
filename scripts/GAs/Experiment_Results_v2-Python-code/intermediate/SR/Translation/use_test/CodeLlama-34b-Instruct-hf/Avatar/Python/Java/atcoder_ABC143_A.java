Note: In Java, we use the `Queue` interface to represent a queue, and the `Thread` class to represent a thread. We also use the `Runnable` interface to define a task that can be executed by a thread.

In this code, we create a `Scanner` object to read input from the user, and then we create a `Queue` object to store the results of the calculation. We also define a `Thread` object to run the calculation in a separate thread.

The `calculate` method is defined to perform the calculation, and it takes three integer arguments: `operandOne`, `multiplier`, and `operandTwo`. The method returns the result of the calculation.

In the `main` method, we start the thread by calling the `start` method on the `Thread` object, and then we wait for the thread to finish by calling the `join` method on the `Thread` object. Once the thread has finished, we retrieve the result of the calculation from the queue and store it in the `resultCalculate0` variable.

We then check the conditions and update the `ans` variable accordingly. Finally, we print the result to the console.
