Note: The `gcd` function is a built-in function in Java, so we don't need to implement it ourselves.

Explanation:

The Python code you provided is a bit complex, so I'll break it down into smaller parts to explain how it works.

1. The `my_decorator` function is a decorator function that takes another function as an argument. It returns a new function that wraps the original function and adds some additional functionality. In this case, the additional functionality is to shuffle the input array and then call the original function with the shuffled array.
2. The `CalculateGCD` function is the function that we want to decorate. It takes two integer arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their greatest common divisor.
3. The `gcd` function is a built-in function in Python that calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers.
4. The `input_number` variable is the input number that we want to calculate the GCD of.
5. The `print` statement at the end of the code prints the result of the `CalculateGCD` function.

In Java, we don't have a built-in `gcd` function, so we need to implement it ourselves. We can do this using the Euclidean algorithm, which is a simple and efficient method for calculating the GCD of two integers.

The `CalculateGCD` function in Java is similar to the one in Python, but it takes two `int` arguments instead of two `Integer` arguments. We also need to add a `return` statement at the end of the function to return the result of the calculation.

The `main` method in Java is the entry point of the program, and it takes an array of `String` arguments as input. We can use the `Integer.parseInt` method to convert the input string to an integer, and then pass it to the `CalculateGCD` function.

Finally, we print the result of the `CalculateGCD` function using the `System.out.println` method.
