This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads an integer from the standard input, then reads that many integers from the standard input, and stores them in a list. It then calculates the difference between the last integer read and the first one, and adds this to the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of integers in the list. The result is printed to the standard output.

The Java code uses a `Callable` and `ExecutorService` to run the calculation in a separate thread. The `Callable` interface is used to return a result from a method, and the `ExecutorService` is used to run the `Callable` in a separate thread.

Note that the `scipy.stats.ttest_ind` function is not used in the Python code, but it is used in the Java code to demonstrate how to use a library function. In this case, the function is not used in the final result calculation, so it is not included in the Java code.
