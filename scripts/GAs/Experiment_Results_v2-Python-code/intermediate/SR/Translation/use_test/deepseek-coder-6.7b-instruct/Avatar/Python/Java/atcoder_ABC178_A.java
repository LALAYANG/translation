```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a == 0 ? 1 : 0);
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code you provided. It reads an integer from the standard input, and then prints 1 if the integer is 0, and 0 otherwise.
