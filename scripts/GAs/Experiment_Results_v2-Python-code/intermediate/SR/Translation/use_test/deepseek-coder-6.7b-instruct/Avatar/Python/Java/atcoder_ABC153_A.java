```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int total_items = scanner.nextInt();
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int sho = total_items / a;
        int remainder_items = total_items % a;
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
        if (remainder_items != 0) {
            Future<Integer> future = executorService.submit(() -> calculateSho(1, sho));
            sho = future.get();
        }
        System.out.println(sho);
        executorService.shutdown();
    }

    public static int calculateSho(int increment_value, int sho) {
        return sho + increment_value;
    }
}
```

This Java code does the same thing as the Python code. It reads two integers from the standard input, calculates `sho`, and if `remainder_items` is not zero, it uses a thread to calculate `sho` again. The result is then printed to the standard output.

Please note that Java does not have built-in libraries for machine learning or statistics like Python does. The `calculateSho` method in the Python code is a placeholder for a hypothetical method that performs some calculation. In the Java code, this method is simply a placeholder for a hypothetical method that performs some calculation.
