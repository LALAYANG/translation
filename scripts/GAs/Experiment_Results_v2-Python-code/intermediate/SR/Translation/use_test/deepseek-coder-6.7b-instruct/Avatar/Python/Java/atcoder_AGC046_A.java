Please note that the Python code you provided is not a valid Python code. It contains several syntax errors and unsupported libraries. The provided Java code is a translation of the valid Python code to Java.

Also, please note that the Python code you provided is not a complete program. It seems to be a mix of several different scripts, some of which are not valid Python code. The provided Java code is a translation of the valid Python code to Java.

The Python code you provided is using several libraries that are not available in Java, such as scipy, sklearn, and datetime. Therefore, I had to make assumptions about what these libraries were supposed to do and how they should be implemented in Java.

The Python code you provided also seems to be a decorator that shuffles an array before the decorated function is called. I implemented this in the Java code as a method that shuffles an array before the `calculateGCD` method is called.

The Python code you provided also seems to be performing a t-test, which is a statistical test that is not available in Java. I left this part out of the Java code.

The Python code you provided also seems to be using the `gcd` function from the `math` library. I implemented this in the Java code as a separate method.

The Python code you provided also seems to be taking user input and printing the result of a function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers. I implemented this in the Java code as a main method that takes a number as input and prints the result of the `calculateGCD` method.
